# 06 Section 23 restored verbatim from the iteration-4 report

## 23. What we have learned so far (end of iteration 3)

Three iterations, twelve artifacts (ten commissioned, eight completed in iteration 1; five completed in iteration 2; four completed in iteration 3) have tested whether temporal network signals predict how new scientific concepts spread across disciplines, using OpenAlex data on up to 12,499 concepts with up to 27,393 concept by field adoption episodes.

**Confirmed findings:**

1. **Retaining relatedness predicts the next field entered, beyond the Hidalgo/Guevara RCA density rival (the retained frontier hypothesis, PARTIAL).** A conditional logit on concept year risk sets shows that relatedness to the fields currently retaining a concept predicts which field the concept enters next, beyond field size, the conventional RCA > 1 density (D_rca), share weighted current presence density (D_vol), ever entered density, relatedness to home, and the target field's own gateway centrality. On an independent frame of 3,162 heldout concepts (6,978 entry events), d0_ret_rel = 0.322 (95% CI [0.291, 0.355]), LR = 325.8. DerSimonian-Laird pooled over 4 heldout groups: 0.243 [0.118, 0.368], I squared = 0.92. Positive in 3 of 3 evaluable groups (PHYS 0.148, LIFEENV 0.401, SOC 0.297; MATHDEC null). Cohort (2010-2014): 0.321. Permutation p = 0.001, rewired backbone p = 0.004, node label p = 0.003 (all Holm corrected < 0.01). **However:** the volume matched contrast is null on heldout data (Holm p = 0.76), so persistence and volume are confounded. The conditional logit's d0 may reflect sustained volume rather than adapted knowledge. The verdict is PARTIAL. The dose response is monotone nondecreasing (age 2: 0.056, age 3: 0.103, age 4+: 0.251; contrast 4+ vs 2: 0.195 [0.153, 0.236]).

2. **Seven of 10 early network indicators are confirmed for predicting rarefied field breadth on heldout fields (the indicator screen deliverable).** The confirmed indicators (Holm p < 0.05, CI excluding zero, sign agreement 6/6 across 4 heldout groups + 2 cohort parts) are: M0_density_end (+0.375), D_vol_end (+0.307), CONTACT_REACH (+0.211), n_comm_W3 (+0.167), NOV (+0.151), RETENTION_RATIO_early (-0.114), and ego_density_W3 (-0.102). They span relatedness and cooccurrence families. An ElasticNet combining all indicators adds +0.059 (CI [0.046, 0.073]) Spearman correlation over the five feature baseline on 1,833 heldout concepts.

3. **Retaining relatedness predicts the next field entered (the entry hypothesis, confirmed on holdout data in iteration 2).** Holdout LR 71.7 (p = 2.5e-17), standardised d = 0.30 (95% CI [0.24, 0.37]), DL pooled d = 0.28 (95% CI [0.22, 0.35], I squared = 0). This was confirmed in iteration 2 and is now replicated on a separate frame in iteration 3 with additional RCA and volume density rivals.

4. **Two stable trajectory classes.** DTW k-medoids separates 188 concepts into "integrating" (128 concepts, mean 6.7 fields retaining by year 9) and "localised" (60 concepts, mean 2.9 fields retaining). Holdout recluster ARI = 0.54.

5. **Background homophily dominates raw lineage (methodological finding).** Two thirds of between concept variance in raw lineage log odds is general disciplinary homophily.

6. **Edge persistence is negatively associated with breadth (preregistered prediction 2: HOLDS).** Concepts whose cooccurrence edges persist between windows spread less broadly. Pooled PSP = -0.080 [-0.126, -0.033].

**Disconfirmed or downgraded:**

1. **Gateway centrality does not predict field retention.** Disconfirmed on 27,393 episodes (iteration 2). The iteration-1 lead (+0.103 on 80 episodes) was a small sample artefact.

2. **No concept level network indicator beats the simple baseline for raw breadth (iteration 1).** All three theory driven indicators (naturalisation gap, structural diversity, gateway landing) fail the preregistered decision rule. The learned model (iteration 3) does add +0.059 over the five feature baseline using multiple indicators jointly.

3. **Volume matched persistence is null on heldout data (iteration 3).** The retained frontier hypothesis is PARTIAL: persistence and volume are confounded.

4. **Abandonment penalty is inconclusive.** d_lost = -0.007 [-0.036, 0.022] on the independent frame (iteration 3), not replicating the Experiment 6 estimate of -0.063.

5. **External recognition is unrelated to publication outcomes.** Pooled rho with O2r_m50: 0.014 [-0.045, 0.073]. external recognition measures prior recognition (67% at or before t0), not diffusion success.

6. **Rescue and relay mechanisms are not supported (iteration 2).** Neither reimportation nor onward radiation is detectable.

**Open:**

- The retained frontier claim's novelty against a persistence filtered RCA density rival (D_rca_persist_k) is untested.
- Neighbour momentum density (relatedness weighted usage growth) is the main uncontrolled confound.
- The "explain why strongest indicator works" analysis and case studies are not started.
- The AI first stage (exploratory nonlinear screening) is not started.
- Candidate S (unconnected coauthor groups, Cheng et al. 2023) remains untested.
- The HMM trajectory model (6 states, ARI 0.094 with DTW) from Experiment 6 is a direct robustness failure for the "two stable classes" claim.

[Correction, iteration 5, from iter_4 report] Section 23 was a stub in the iteration-5 report. The text above is restored byte-for-byte from `iter_4/gen_strat/current_report.md` lines 1216-1255 (heading suffix '(end of iteration 3)' added).

**Corrections to the restored Section 23 (iteration 5):**

- [Correction, iteration 5, from art_22ppE1snfHKj] The dose response is **not monotone** on held-out data: betas by persistence age 2 / 3 / ≥4 are 0.10 / 0.08 / 0.30.
- [Correction, iteration 5, from art_uw4OeagJP3rv] The trajectory typology is a **continuum**, not two classes: DTW-HMM ARI 0.222.
- [Correction, iteration 5, from art_oKOd21ZMnu9S] The volume-matched contrast (retained vs entered-not-retained fields) is null on DEV too: -0.008 [-0.071, +0.050].


## Tag under 16.2

 [Correction, iteration 5, from art_uw4OeagJP3rv] Superseded: at higher resolution the typology is a continuum (DTW-HMM ARI 0.222; Section 26.2).
