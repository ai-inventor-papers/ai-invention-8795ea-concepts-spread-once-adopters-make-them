<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviewer (Step 2.2: REVIEW_HYPO)

Pipeline: GEN_HYPO → REVIEW_HYPO (you) → INVENTION_LOOP → GEN_PAPER_REPO

You review a hypothesis BEFORE any experiments run. Catch problems early.

Rigorous pre-flight check → saves compute. Rubber-stamping → wasted pipeline run.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

ROLE: You are a very experienced and critical conference reviewer.
Your expertise spans the domain of the hypothesis under review.
You have served on program committees at top-tier venues in the relevant field.

TASK: Perform a deep and honest review (at the level of a top-tier venue submission) of
this research hypothesis BEFORE any experiments have been run.

GOAL: Your review feeds directly back to the hypothesis author. The objective is to
maximize the overall review score in subsequent rounds. Every piece of feedback you
give should be written with this goal in mind — prioritize the critiques and suggestions
that would produce the largest score improvement if addressed. Don't waste the author's
iteration budget on low-impact polish when there are score-blocking issues to fix.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: Provide a thorough assessment touching on each of these:
(a) Originality: Are the ideas new? Novel combination of known techniques? Clear
    differentiation from prior work? Is related work adequately cited?
(b) Quality: Is the proposal technically sound? Are claims well supported? Is the
    methodology appropriate? Are the authors honest about limitations?
(c) Clarity: Is the hypothesis clearly written and well organized? Does it provide
    enough information for an expert to understand and evaluate it?
(d) Significance: Are the expected results important? Would others build on this?
    Does it address a meaningful problem better than prior work?
(e) Fidelity to the user's request: Does this hypothesis answer the request the run
    was commissioned on, shown verbatim in the prompt? Are the subjects, the
    deliverable and the measurement the ones that were asked for, or has the
    hypothesis moved onto a neighbouring question that happens to be freer?

SUPPLEMENTARY SCORES: Rate each on a 1-4 scale.
Soundness (1-4) — soundness of the technical claims and proposed methodology:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Presentation (1-4) — quality of writing, clarity, and contextualization relative to prior work:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Contribution (1-4) — quality of the overall contribution, importance of questions asked,
originality of ideas, value to the broader research community:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor

OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
  10 — Award quality: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on one or more
       areas of the field, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility,
       and resources, and no unaddressed concerns.
   9 — Very Strong Accept: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on at least
       one area and excellent impact on multiple areas, with flawless evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   8 — Strong Accept: Technically strong with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least
       one area or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas, with excellent evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   7 — Accept: Technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area or
       moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation,
       resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   6 — Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns
       with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility.
   5 — Borderline Accept: Technically solid where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to
       reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Use sparingly.
   4 — Borderline Reject: Technically solid where reasons to reject, e.g., limited
       evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept. Use sparingly.
   3 — Reject: For instance, technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility.
   2 — Strong Reject: For instance, major technical flaws, poor evaluation, limited
       impact, poor reproducibility.
   1 — Very Strong Reject: For instance, trivial results or unaddressed concerns.

CONFIDENCE (1-5):
  5: Absolutely certain. Very familiar with related work, checked details carefully.
  4: Confident but not absolutely certain. Unlikely you misunderstood something.
  3: Fairly confident. Possible you missed some related work or details.
  2: Willing to defend your assessment, but quite likely missed central aspects.
  1: Educated guess. Not in your area or difficult to evaluate.

For each dimension, provide a list of specific improvements:
- WHAT needs to change
- HOW to change it (concrete enough for the author to act on immediately)
- EXPECTED SCORE IMPACT: how much would fixing this raise the overall score?

REVIEW PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific and actionable — vague critique is useless
- Ground your review in evidence — search for existing work, accepted papers, known results
- Rank critiques by score impact — address the biggest score blockers first
- Distinguish major issues (would waste compute if not fixed) from minor issues (polish)
- Acknowledge genuine strengths — don't be negative for its own sake
- Compare against the bar set by accepted papers at top-tier venues
- Score the fidelity dimension on the verbatim request in the prompt. A hypothesis that answers a DIFFERENT question than the user asked scores 1 there and earns a MAJOR critique, whatever its originality, soundness or significance — a novel answer to a question nobody asked is a failed run
- Rank a fidelity critique FIRST, ahead of the score-impact ordering. Every other critique improves an answer; this one decides whether it is an answer to the right question. Say which subject, deliverable or measurement from the request went missing, and what restores it
- Flag fatal flaws that would make experiments pointless if not addressed first
- Screen the hypothesis for prior art before any compute is spent. Search the web for the proposed idea, its method name, and its central claim. If the idea already exists, say so and name the source — this is the cheapest point in the pipeline to catch it
- Distinguish a genuinely new idea from a restatement of known work in new vocabulary. Coining a term for an existing method is not originality, and should be scored as a major issue
- Judge ambition against what the request left OPEN. The less the request constrained, the more of that space the hypothesis was expected to claim; a safe, small study in answer to a wide-open question is a major issue, not a minor one
- Reject measurement dressed as contribution: an established measure, instrument or method applied to more cases — more models, languages, periods, countries, corpora or settings — is a table, not a finding. Say so plainly and ask for a claim that would change what someone in the field does or believes
- Ask whether the hypothesis is POSITIVE BY DESIGN — is there a mechanism that predicts the effect, or is the outcome a coin flip? If the direction is genuinely unknown, require that both outcomes be informative, or the run risks ending with an uninformative negative result

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/iter_1/review_hypo`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/iter_1/review_hypo/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/iter_1/review_hypo/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/iter_1/review_hypo/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.

Research task: Exploring emerging scientific concepts through evolving knowledge networks
The objective of this task is to investigate whether temporal changes in the structure of scientific knowledge networks can reveal and explain the emergence of scientific concepts. The study should use an OpenAlex-based scholarly dataset, or a comparable large-scale publication dataset containing publication dates, textual metadata, disciplinary classifications, and, where useful, citation information.
Scientific emergence should be treated as a dynamic network process rather than simply as increasing popularity. A concept may emerge by acquiring new semantic or co-occurrence relations, becoming more structurally central, connecting previously separated research communities, or spreading from a specialized disciplinary context into a broader scientific landscape. The study should therefore identify which structural signals accompany or anticipate such changes and determine whether these signals generalize across scientific domains.
The study should address the following research questions:
RQ1: Which temporal network indicators reliably characterize and anticipate the emergence of scientific concepts across different scientific domains?
RQ2: How do emerging scientific concepts diffuse across disciplinary communities over time, and which network trajectories distinguish locally concentrated concepts from concepts that become broadly integrated into the scientific knowledge network?
A possible execution scenario is:
1.    Explore a focused set of concepts and network trajectories. Begin with one well-defined, rapidly evolving scientific area, for example Artificial Intelligence, and construct a semantically grounded temporal knowledge network for a manageable set of concepts. Inspect the network evolution openly before fixing the final methodology. Examine how known concepts change over time in terms of connectivity, new neighbors, community membership, centrality, and disciplinary distribution. Include concepts with visibly different trajectories: rapid emergence, gradual growth, local specialization, cross-disciplinary diffusion, and temporary expansion. The purpose of this stage is exploratory: identify which structural changes appear meaningful and which graph representations best capture them.
2.    Design a broad set of candidate emergence indicators. Based on the exploratory analysis and relevant literature on temporal networks, knowledge graphs, scientometrics, innovation diffusion, and community evolution, define a relatively large set of candidate indicators, for example 30--50 measures. These may include degree and weighted-degree growth, new-edge formation, edge persistence, neighborhood novelty, centrality change, community transitions, participation coefficient, brokerage, disciplinary reach, disciplinary entropy, diffusion velocity, and changes in local clustering. Include several simple concept-level temporal measures as reference points so that it is possible to determine whether sophisticated network information provides useful additional signal. The indicators should not all be minor variations of the same measure; they should reflect different aspects of network emergence.
3.    Test the indicators on a substantially wider collection of scientific domains and concepts. Apply all candidate indicators beyond the exploratory domain. Include fast- and slow-evolving fields, concepts originating in different scientific communities, concepts that remain discipline-specific, and concepts that subsequently become interdisciplinary. The evaluation should explicitly test whether indicators generalize across domains rather than working only in one field. Reserve complete scientific fields, time intervals, or concept groups as a held-out evaluation set that is not used when selecting or tuning the indicators. Selecting the best indicators and testing them on the same concepts would otherwise overestimate their usefulness.
4.    Define independent ground truth for scientific emergence and diffusion. Validation should not rely only on visual inspection of the constructed network or on a single operational definition of emergence. Establish several measurable outcomes representing different aspects of scientific emergence. These may include subsequent sustained publication uptake of a concept, future citation growth, expansion into previously unrelated subfields, persistence over several future periods, or externally documented recognition of a technology or research topic. Where feasible, use external sources such as scientific taxonomies, technology reports, review papers, curated emerging-topic lists, or other independent evidence. Emergence should not be defined only as rapid growth: a short-lived spike should not automatically be considered equivalent to persistent scientific integration. Similarly, a concept that becomes very frequent within one narrow subfield should be distinguishable from one that diffuses broadly across science.
5.    Identify and validate the strongest network indicators. Select the most promising indicators using only the development data, and evaluate approximately the 10 strongest measures on the held-out concepts/domains. Test their association with the ground-truth outcomes using correlation, ranking, or predictive evaluation as appropriate. Report results both globally and within individual scientific fields. The resampling unit should be clearly defined—for example concepts, subfields, or temporal windows—and results should be aggregated both across concepts and across domains. If an indicator performs well only in one domain, such as Artificial Intelligence, but fails to generalize to other scientific fields, this should be reported as an important negative result rather than averaged away.
6.    Use the strongest indicators to investigate RQ2 and derive diffusion trajectories. For concepts identified as emerging, analyze how their structural position changes over time. Study disciplinary reach, entropy, community transitions, brokerage, and cross-community connectivity. Rather than defining classes beforehand, derive recurring trajectories empirically. Possible outcomes may include localized emergence, rapid interdisciplinary diffusion, gradual network integration, transient expansion, or increasing structural brokerage. Examine whether there are systematic temporal sequences—for example whether concepts first become central within their original community and subsequently diffuse across disciplines, or whether some concepts emerge directly at the intersection of several communities.
Additional analysis -- explaining why the strongest indicators work. If one or more measures prove particularly robust, perform a detailed network analysis of what they are capturing. Identify which periods, network neighborhoods, edge types, communities, or structural transitions generate the signal. Representative concept case studies should be selected from the quantitative results and used to visualize these mechanisms.
Optional extension -- learned emergence model. Instead of relying exclusively on individual predefined metrics, train a small interpretable model using temporal network features to predict future emergence or diffusion outcomes. Compare it with the strongest individual indicators on the same held-out evaluation set. If the learned model performs substantially better, analyze which network features and temporal patterns it uses and whether these patterns have a meaningful interpretation in terms of scientific knowledge evolution.
Expected outcome
The expected outcome is not merely a list or ranking of emerging scientific concepts, but a validated framework for identifying and explaining scientific emergence through temporal network structure. The study should determine which network signals are robust across scientific domains, which signals are domain-specific, and how concepts transition from local research topics to broadly connected elements of the scientific knowledge network. 
We expect the final result as publication in the specific journal format mentioned above, in the structure that other papers from this journal have, with citations from the related work from the selected journal, with comparison to the related work. For each research question we would like to have experimental setup, comparison to related work if available, produced results and discussed outcomes. We would also like to have a general methodology presented in graphical form and clearly explained in the paper. Use the following API key for OpenAlex: q0jD2k15XbNV0E3SFHhpr0

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Concepts that take root outside home spread
hypothesis: >-
  A scientific concept becomes broadly and durably integrated into the knowledge network when it becomes SELF-REPRODUCING
  outside its home discipline. Growth, centrality and the number of disciplines it touches are not enough. 'Self-reproducing'
  means that, in some non-home discipline, new papers using the concept draw mainly on earlier concept-papers from that same
  discipline (or from another non-home discipline), not on the home field. We make this measurable with a concept-specific
  NEXT-GENERATION MATRIX K_c(t), a tool borrowed from epidemiology. Entry K_ij is the number of new papers in discipline j
  that use concept c, per c-paper in discipline i in the preceding window. A new paper is attributed to earlier papers through
  citation links among papers that use c. Papers with no cited c-parent count as 'imports'. From K_c we derive four indicators:
  (a) R_away, the spectral radius of K_c restricted to non-home disciplines, i.e. whether the concept can sustain itself outside
  home without continued supply from home; (b) per-discipline self-reproduction K_jj, where a discipline is a 'source' if
  K_jj >= 1 and a 'sink' otherwise; (c) the number of naturalized (source) disciplines; (d) import dependence. Predictions.
  (P1, RQ1) On held-out scientific fields and a later time cohort, R_away and the naturalized-discipline count measured in
  a concept's first 3-5 years predict broad, persistent integration 8 years later. They do this better than popularity measures
  (counts, growth, bursts), co-occurrence degree and centrality growth, and early disciplinary reach or entropy. They also
  hold their rank across fields, because the critical value of a reproduction number is fixed at 1 by theory rather than by
  field size. (P2) Reach without reproduction is transient. Among concepts with the same high early disciplinary entropy,
  those with R_away < 1 stagnate or retract, while those with R_away > 1 keep expanding. This is the signal that separates
  a short-lived spike from real integration. (P3, RQ2) Diffusion trajectories follow the stages of biological invasion: home-confined,
  casual spillover (present in other fields only as sinks), naturalized (1-2 source disciplines) and invasive cascade (source
  disciplines seeding new sources). The first 'naturalization event' (some non-home K_jj crossing 1) precedes the rise of
  disciplinary entropy, participation coefficient and brokerage in the concept co-occurrence network by 1-3 years. Concepts
  born at disciplinary intersections show two or more source disciplines from their first window.
motivation: >-
  The emerging-topic literature treats emergence mostly as growth, or as structural prominence in a co-word or co-occurrence
  network. Examples are Rotolo et al.'s five attributes, Salatino et al.'s pre-emergence collaboration density, Chen's structural
  variation and burst detection. For diffusion (RQ2), the best-known predictor of wide spread is early community spread, i.e.
  how many communities a meme or topic has already touched (Weng et al. 2013). But touching a discipline is not the same as
  taking root in it. Many concepts appear in a neighbouring field only because authors there cite the home field's papers,
  as borrowed tools. These footholds collapse when the home field's interest fades, which is exactly the 'temporary expansion'
  and short-lived-spike problem the task highlights. Epidemiology and population ecology solved this long ago. A sub-population
  supported only by immigration (a sink) is diagnosed by a local reproduction number below 1, whatever its current size. Invasion
  biology separates 'casual' aliens that need repeated introduction from 'naturalized' self-sustaining populations. Transferring
  this lets us measure something nobody has measured for scientific concepts: whether each discipline reproduces a concept
  on its own or only receives it. If the hypothesis holds, it changes practice in three ways. (1) Emergence monitoring (funders,
  foresight units, taxonomy curators such as MeSH, and OpenAlex topic maintainers) should track per-discipline self-reproduction
  instead of counts and reach. (2) The indicator has a theory-given threshold (1), so it can be used in a new field without
  tuning. The task explicitly asks for this kind of generalization, and field-size-dependent indicators such as degree growth
  cannot provide it. (3) It explains rather than merely predicts: it tells us which discipline pair carries the signal and
  when a concept stops being borrowed and starts being practiced. The same framework produces the full 30-50-indicator comparison
  the task asks for, so the novel indicator family is tested head-to-head against the established ones, on held-out fields,
  with independent ground truth.
assumptions:
- >-
  Citation links between papers that use the same concept are a usable proxy for transmission of that concept. A quick OpenAlex
  probe on 'federated learning' (2015-2019, concept-tagged works) found 84% of concept-papers carry reference lists and 64%
  cite at least one earlier concept-paper, enough to estimate K_c. Missing references bias K downward roughly uniformly, which
  can be corrected by scaling with per-discipline attribution coverage. Ranking-based evaluations are unaffected.
- >-
  A work's OpenAlex field or subfield (from its primary topic; 26 fields, 252 subfields) is an adequate proxy for its disciplinary
  community. The home discipline of a concept is the modal field of its first ~30 papers, and multi-home concepts are flagged,
  not forced.
- >-
  Concept membership can be semantically grounded with enough precision. We combine OpenAlex concepts/keywords that carry
  Wikidata IDs with exact phrase matching in titles and abstracts ('title_and_abstract.search'). Ambiguous surface forms are
  disambiguated on a sample with a cheap LLM or embedding check (<$1 total).
- >-
  During the early emergence window (first 3-8 years), saturation is weak enough that a linear branching-with-immigration
  approximation is informative. The claim concerns early-window indicators, not the full life cycle.
- >-
  Independent outcome signals exist for enough concepts: future OpenAlex uptake and breadth, citation growth, MeSH descriptor
  introduction year for biomedical concepts, Wikipedia article creation dates, and curated research-front lists. Together
  they separate persistent broad integration from local specialization and transient spikes.
investigation_approach: >-
  DATA ECONOMY FIRST. The run's OpenAlex key reports a limit of 10,000 credits and $1 per day, with one list call costing
  one credit. So every concept is downloaded ONCE, as early-window works with select=id,publication_year,primary_topic,topics,keywords,concepts,referenced_works,cited_by_count,
  and that single download feeds both the co-occurrence network and the citation-based next-generation matrix. Background
  frequencies (field sizes, concept counts per year and field, future outcomes) come from cheap group_by calls (one credit
  each). Before building anything, check existing resources: SciSciNet (MAG-derived, with fields and concept tags), the OpenAlex
  topic/concept hierarchy with Wikidata links, the NLM MeSH XML (DateCreated for descriptors), the Wikimedia API (article
  creation dates), and Clarivate Research Fronts PDFs. No model training is needed beyond a small interpretable classifier
  (optional extension). LLM spend stays under $1 (sense disambiguation on a sample only). Target: ~400-600 concepts, each
  capped at the first ~3,000 papers of its window, for ~6-8k calls in total. STEP 1, EXPLORATORY (AI / Computer Science, ~60
  concepts with known contrasting trajectories: e.g. federated learning, GANs, transformers/attention, graph neural networks,
  explainable AI, blockchain, big data, edge computing, capsule networks, extreme learning machine, AutoML). Build yearly
  (and 3-year sliding) concept co-occurrence networks with nodes = grounded concepts and edges = co-use in a paper, with weights
  normalized against a frequency null (hypergeometric/PMI). Build citation lineages within each concept and estimate K_c(t)
  in 3-year windows. Inspect trajectories of degree, new neighbours, community membership (Leiden per slice, aligned across
  slices), centrality, disciplinary distribution and K_c before freezing the design. The probe already shows that for federated
  learning 2016-21, Engineering received 69 attributed transmissions from Computer Science but reproduced itself only ~10
  times (a sink), while CS->Medicine spillover was ~9 with ~0 Medicine->Medicine. STEP 2, CANDIDATE INDICATORS (~40, in 8
  families so that no family is a minor variant of another). (A) Popularity baselines: count, share, growth rate, acceleration,
  Kleinberg burst weight, author-count growth. (B) Co-occurrence connectivity: degree and strength growth, new-edge rate,
  edge persistence, neighbourhood turnover (Jaccard), frequency-residualized selectivity (PMI growth). (C) Centrality: eigenvector,
  PageRank, betweenness change, k-core shell change. (D) Community: participation coefficient, community-transition count,
  Burt constraint/brokerage, structural diversity of new neighbours. (E) Closure: local clustering change, triadic-closure
  rate among neighbours. (F) Disciplinary: field reach, Shannon entropy, Rao-Stirling diversity, diffusion velocity (fields
  gained per year). (G) Citation-lineage / next-generation matrix (novel family): R_home, R_away, per-field K_jj, number of
  naturalized fields, type-reproduction number of the best non-home field, import dependence, cross-field attribution share.
  (H) Semantic: drift and dispersion of the concept's context-embedding centroid (small sentence-embedding model on titles,
  CPU). All indicators are computed on the first 3 and first 5 years after a concept's onset (the year it first reaches 20
  papers). STEP 3, WIDER DOMAINS WITH STRICT HOLD-OUT. Development set: CS/AI plus Biochemistry/Genetics/Medicine concepts
  with onset 2004-2011. Held-out set, never used for selection or tuning: whole fields (e.g. Materials Science/Physics, Earth
  and Environmental Science, Social Sciences/Economics, Agricultural and Biological Sciences, Chemistry/Engineering) and a
  later onset cohort (2012-2015) in all fields. Concepts are stratified by onset field and outcome type, and include negative
  and control concepts (steady-state and declining concepts matched on early size). STEP 4, INDEPENDENT MULTI-FACETED GROUND
  TRUTH at horizon onset+8 years (outcome windows never overlap feature windows). O1 sustained uptake: field-normalized share
  in years 6-8 at or above the year-5 share, with no collapse. O2 broad integration: number of fields with sustained presence
  (>= k papers per year for 3 consecutive years) and Rao-Stirling diversity. O3 transience: peak-to-final ratio of yearly
  counts (spike vs persistence). O4 future citation growth of the concept's papers. O5 external recognition: MeSH descriptor
  created after onset, Wikipedia article created, or listed in Clarivate Research Fronts. Local specialization is defined
  as high O1 with low O2, so 'frequent but narrow' stays distinct from 'broad'. STEP 5, SELECTION AND VALIDATION. Rank indicators
  on development data only (Spearman with each outcome, univariate AUC, and incremental AUC over a popularity-only logistic
  baseline). Freeze the top 10 and evaluate once on held-out fields and the held-out cohort. The resampling unit is the concept,
  with cluster bootstrap by field (2,000 resamples) and leave-one-field-out summaries. Report global, per-field and per-cohort
  results, and state any indicator that works only in AI as a negative result. Test P2 within concepts matched on early disciplinary
  entropy (top tercile) and early outside-home growth: does R_away still separate O2/O3? Test the theory-fixed threshold by
  fitting a logistic of P(broad) on log R_away separately per held-out field and checking that the midpoint lies near R_away
  = 1 after coverage correction. STEP 6, RQ2 TRAJECTORIES. For concepts that emerge, derive trajectories without predefined
  classes. Standardize multivariate time series (R_away, #source fields, disciplinary entropy, participation coefficient,
  brokerage, clustering, community transitions), then cluster with DTW-k-medoids and alternatively a Gaussian HMM, and choose
  k by silhouette and stability. Test whether the clusters match the invasion-stage ordering (home-confined, casual, naturalized,
  invasive), compare against alternative orderings, and run event-sequence analysis: does the first naturalization event precede
  the entropy take-off and the betweenness peak? Use sign tests and a Cox model with time-varying covariates for time to broad
  integration. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS, WHY IT WORKS. Decompose R_away into discipline-pair contributions (eigenvector/sensitivity
  analysis of K) to find which discipline pairs, periods and bridging papers produce the signal. Contrast co-occurrence neighbourhoods
  of sink-phase and source-phase papers in the same field. Pick case studies from the quantitative results (e.g. a naturalized
  concept, a casual-spillover concept with a spike, a concept born at an intersection) and visualize them. OPTIONAL EXTENSION.
  Train an Explainable Boosting Machine or L1-logistic model on all indicators (development data only) and compare it with
  the best single indicator on the same held-out set. Report whether it wins substantially and which interactions (e.g. entropy
  x R_away) it uses. The paper will include a methodology figure (data -> grounding -> dual network -> indicator families
  -> hold-out validation -> trajectory derivation) and follow the target Springer collection's structure, citing related work
  published there.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if all of the following hold on HELD-OUT fields and cohort only. (1) R_away or the naturalized-field count ranks
  in the top 3 of ~40 indicators for the broad-integration outcome (O2). It reaches AUC >= 0.75 and a bootstrap-significant
  incremental AUC of >= 0.05 over BOTH the best popularity baseline and early disciplinary entropy/reach. This must hold in
  at least 4 of 5 held-out fields, not just pooled. (2) Among concepts matched on high early disciplinary entropy and outside-home
  growth, R_away separates persistent-broad from transient/retracting concepts (O3) with AUC >= 0.70. This is the 'reach without
  reproduction is transient' test. (3) Fitted per-field logistic midpoints of P(broad | R_away) lie within [0.8, 1.25] after
  coverage correction, i.e. a theory-fixed threshold transfers without tuning. (4) Among concepts that become broad, the first
  non-home naturalization event precedes the disciplinary-entropy take-off in >= 60% of cases (sign test p < 0.05). Empirically
  derived trajectory clusters are ordered in a way consistent with casual -> naturalized -> invasive stages more often than
  any alternative ordering. PARTIAL: (1) holds pooled but fails in some fields, e.g. low-citation-coverage social sciences.
  This is reported as a domain boundary with attribution coverage as the explaining variable. DISCONFIRMED if R_away adds
  no incremental value over outside-home growth plus entropy (bootstrap CI of delta-AUC includes 0) in most held-out fields,
  or if it works only in AI/CS. In that case the paper still reports the full 40-indicator cross-domain comparison, which
  indicators generalize, and the trajectory taxonomy, as the task requests.

inspiration: >-
  Three imports from population biology and epidemiology, used at the methodological level (not as metaphor). (1) The next-generation
  matrix and type-reproduction numbers of multi-type epidemics (Diekmann, Heesterbeek & Roberts 2010; Roberts & Heesterbeek
  2003) give the estimator K_c and its spectral radius, with a critical value of 1 that is fixed by theory. This is what makes
  cross-domain transfer plausible without tuning. (2) Source-sink metapopulation ecology (Pulliam 1988): a local population
  can be large yet exist only through immigration, so size and presence are not viability. This is the diagnostic that separates
  a concept being 'present in' a discipline from being 'practiced by' it. (3) The introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum
  of invasion biology (Richardson et al. 2000; Blackburn et al. 2011) supplies falsifiable stage predictions for RQ2: casual
  aliens need repeated propagule pressure, naturalized populations self-sustain, and invasive ones spread from new foci. The
  move is to relax an assumption inherited by emergence indicators, namely that presence, reach and centrality in a discipline
  mean integration, and to measure the missing quantity, per-discipline self-reproduction. The existing co-occurrence and
  centrality indicators are kept as rivals, so the claim is tested, not assumed.
terms:
- term: Concept-paper
  definition: >-
    A publication whose title/abstract or OpenAlex concept/keyword tags ground it to a given concept (with a Wikidata-linked
    identity where available).
- term: Home discipline
  definition: >-
    The OpenAlex field (or subfield) in which most of a concept's earliest papers (first ~30) appear. A concept can have more
    than one if its first papers are split.
- term: Next-generation matrix K_c(t)
  definition: >-
    For concept c and time window t, a matrix whose entry K_ij is the number of new c-papers in discipline j attributed to
    each c-paper of discipline i in the previous window. Attribution uses citations from the new paper to earlier c-papers,
    split equally among cited c-parents. New c-papers that cite no earlier c-paper are counted separately as imports.
- term: R_away
  definition: >-
    The spectral radius (largest eigenvalue) of K_c restricted to non-home disciplines. R_away > 1 means the concept can keep
    reproducing outside its home field without further supply from home. R_away < 1 means its presence elsewhere depends on
    imports from home.
- term: Source / sink discipline (for a concept)
  definition: >-
    A discipline j is a source for concept c when its self-reproduction K_jj >= 1 (it sustains the concept on its own), and
    a sink when K_jj < 1 (the concept is present there only because it keeps being imported).
- term: Naturalization event
  definition: >-
    The first time window in which some non-home discipline becomes a source for the concept (its K_jj crosses 1). The term
    is borrowed from invasion biology, where a naturalized species reproduces without further introductions.
- term: Import dependence
  definition: >-
    The share of a discipline's new c-papers attributed to c-papers from other disciplines (mostly the home field) rather
    than to its own earlier c-papers.
- term: Disciplinary entropy / reach
  definition: >-
    Shannon entropy of a concept's paper distribution over disciplines, and the number of disciplines with at least k papers.
    These are the standard 'breadth' measures and the main rivals of R_away.
- term: Participation coefficient
  definition: >-
    For a node in the concept co-occurrence network, 1 minus the sum over communities of (share of its edge weight going to
    that community) squared. High values mean its links are spread across communities.
- term: Structural diversity
  definition: >-
    The number of mutually unconnected groups (components or communities) among a concept's co-occurrence neighbours, taken
    from complex-contagion research (Ugander et al. 2012).
- term: Held-out field / cohort
  definition: >-
    Entire scientific fields and a later onset-year cohort that are never used for choosing, tuning or ranking indicators,
    and are used only for the final evaluation.
- term: Broad integration (outcome O2)
  definition: >-
    At 8 years after onset, sustained presence (>= k papers/year for 3 consecutive years) in many disciplines plus high Rao-Stirling
    diversity. It is distinguished from local specialization (sustained but narrow) and from transient spikes (high peak-to-final
    ratio).
summary: >-
  We measure, for each emerging concept and each discipline, whether the concept reproduces itself there: new papers in that
  discipline build on the discipline's own earlier papers about the concept, not only on papers from the concept's home field.
  We estimate this with a citation-based next-generation matrix borrowed from epidemiology. The hypothesis is that off-home
  self-reproduction (R_away > 1, 'naturalization') predicts broad and lasting integration on held-out fields better than growth,
  centrality or disciplinary reach. It also separates short-lived spillovers from real diffusion, and orders diffusion trajectories
  like the stages of a biological invasion.
alternates:
- title: Diverse entry points beat many neighbours
  hypothesis: >-
    In the concept co-occurrence network, the STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY of a concept's newly acquired neighbours best anticipates
    broad integration, across held-out fields. Structural diversity here is the number of mutually unconnected communities
    they come from, following complex-contagion theory. It beats degree and strength growth, betweenness and disciplinary
    entropy. Concepts whose new ties all fall into one densely connected neighbourhood stay local, even when they grow fast.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    It would beat the main hypothesis if concepts spread mainly by being co-used as tools (via software, textbooks, datasets)
    without citing earlier concept-papers, so that citation lineages under-record transmission while co-occurrence records
    it. It would also win if fields with poor reference coverage (social sciences, humanities) make K_c too noisy.
- title: Relatedness paths decide where concepts go
  hypothesis: >-
    A concept's diffusion across disciplines is predicted by proximity in a discipline-relatedness space, following the principle
    of relatedness from economic complexity. The chance that a concept enters discipline j next rises with the relatedness
    density of j to the disciplines already using it. Broadly integrating concepts are the ones that reach high-centrality
    'gateway' disciplines (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Biochemistry) early. Locally concentrated concepts stay inside
    one relatedness neighbourhood.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If entry into new fields is driven by cognitive proximity and gateway position rather than by concept-specific self-reproduction,
    relatedness density and early gateway reach will predict both the next field entered and final breadth better than R_away.
    The main hypothesis would then describe persistence within a field but not the path of diffusion.
- title: Early-warning slowing before a concept takes off
  hypothesis: >-
    Take-off of a concept is a tipping point in collective attention, preceded by critical-slowing-down signatures in its
    network neighbourhood. Before the growth phase, lag-1 autocorrelation and variance of neighbourhood turnover and of its
    co-occurrence strength rise. These early-warning statistics anticipate the onset of sustained uptake earlier than growth-based
    burst detectors, and in every field.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If emergence behaves like a bistable transition (self-reinforcing attention once a threshold is crossed) rather than a
    gradual branching process, generic early-warning signals from ecology and climate science would give earlier and more
    domain-independent warning than any level-based indicator, including R_away, which needs the concept to be already spreading.
- title: Frequency-free selectivity is the portable signal
  hypothesis: >-
    Most network indicators fail to generalize across fields because they inherit field size and growth rate. Indicators expressed
    as deviations from a frequency-matched null (co-occurrence selectivity or PMI growth, new-neighbour novelty relative to
    a degree-preserving expectation) are the ones that keep their predictive rank on held-out fields. Raw degree, strength
    and centrality rank well only in the field they were tuned on (e.g. AI).
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If the main cross-domain failure of emergence indicators is baseline confounding rather than a missing mechanism, null-residualized
    co-occurrence indicators would generalize as well as R_away, at lower data cost (no reference lists needed) and with coverage
    in fields where citation data are sparse.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Score the fidelity dimension against the <commissioned_request> above: 4 when the hypothesis
answers that request, 1 when it answers a different question. Anything below 3 is a MAJOR
critique of category "scope", listed FIRST, naming the subject, deliverable or measurement
from the request that went missing and the cheapest way back to it. A hypothesis that has
moved off the request does not earn a pass on originality or significance.

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

Research task: Exploring emerging scientific concepts through evolving knowledge networks
The objective of this task is to investigate whether temporal changes in the structure of scientific knowledge networks can reveal and explain the emergence of scientific concepts. The study should use an OpenAlex-based scholarly dataset, or a comparable large-scale publication dataset containing publication dates, textual metadata, disciplinary classifications, and, where useful, citation information.
Scientific emergence should be treated as a dynamic network process rather than simply as increasing popularity. A concept may emerge by acquiring new semantic or co-occurrence relations, becoming more structurally central, connecting previously separated research communities, or spreading from a specialized disciplinary context into a broader scientific landscape. The study should therefore identify which structural signals accompany or anticipate such changes and determine whether these signals generalize across scientific domains.
The study should address the following research questions:
RQ1: Which temporal network indicators reliably characterize and anticipate the emergence of scientific concepts across different scientific domains?
RQ2: How do emerging scientific concepts diffuse across disciplinary communities over time, and which network trajectories distinguish locally concentrated concepts from concepts that become broadly integrated into the scientific knowledge network?
A possible execution scenario is:
1.    Explore a focused set of concepts and network trajectories. Begin with one well-defined, rapidly evolving scientific area, for example Artificial Intelligence, and construct a semantically grounded temporal knowledge network for a manageable set of concepts. Inspect the network evolution openly before fixing the final methodology. Examine how known concepts change over time in terms of connectivity, new neighbors, community membership, centrality, and disciplinary distribution. Include concepts with visibly different trajectories: rapid emergence, gradual growth, local specialization, cross-disciplinary diffusion, and temporary expansion. The purpose of this stage is exploratory: identify which structural changes appear meaningful and which graph representations best capture them.
2.    Design a broad set of candidate emergence indicators. Based on the exploratory analysis and relevant literature on temporal networks, knowledge graphs, scientometrics, innovation diffusion, and community evolution, define a relatively large set of candidate indicators, for example 30--50 measures. These may include degree and weighted-degree growth, new-edge formation, edge persistence, neighborhood novelty, centrality change, community transitions, participation coefficient, brokerage, disciplinary reach, disciplinary entropy, diffusion velocity, and changes in local clustering. Include several simple concept-level temporal measures as reference points so that it is possible to determine whether sophisticated network information provides useful additional signal. The indicators should not all be minor variations of the same measure; they should reflect different aspects of network emergence.
3.    Test the indicators on a substantially wider collection of scientific domains and concepts. Apply all candidate indicators beyond the exploratory domain. Include fast- and slow-evolving fields, concepts originating in different scientific communities, concepts that remain discipline-specific, and concepts that subsequently become interdisciplinary. The evaluation should explicitly test whether indicators generalize across domains rather than working only in one field. Reserve complete scientific fields, time intervals, or concept groups as a held-out evaluation set that is not used when selecting or tuning the indicators. Selecting the best indicators and testing them on the same concepts would otherwise overestimate their usefulness.
4.    Define independent ground truth for scientific emergence and diffusion. Validation should not rely only on visual inspection of the constructed network or on a single operational definition of emergence. Establish several measurable outcomes representing different aspects of scientific emergence. These may include subsequent sustained publication uptake of a concept, future citation growth, expansion into previously unrelated subfields, persistence over several future periods, or externally documented recognition of a technology or research topic. Where feasible, use external sources such as scientific taxonomies, technology reports, review papers, curated emerging-topic lists, or other independent evidence. Emergence should not be defined only as rapid growth: a short-lived spike should not automatically be considered equivalent to persistent scientific integration. Similarly, a concept that becomes very frequent within one narrow subfield should be distinguishable from one that diffuses broadly across science.
5.    Identify and validate the strongest network indicators. Select the most promising indicators using only the development data, and evaluate approximately the 10 strongest measures on the held-out concepts/domains. Test their association with the ground-truth outcomes using correlation, ranking, or predictive evaluation as appropriate. Report results both globally and within individual scientific fields. The resampling unit should be clearly defined—for example concepts, subfields, or temporal windows—and results should be aggregated both across concepts and across domains. If an indicator performs well only in one domain, such as Artificial Intelligence, but fails to generalize to other scientific fields, this should be reported as an important negative result rather than averaged away.
6.    Use the strongest indicators to investigate RQ2 and derive diffusion trajectories. For concepts identified as emerging, analyze how their structural position changes over time. Study disciplinary reach, entropy, community transitions, brokerage, and cross-community connectivity. Rather than defining classes beforehand, derive recurring trajectories empirically. Possible outcomes may include localized emergence, rapid interdisciplinary diffusion, gradual network integration, transient expansion, or increasing structural brokerage. Examine whether there are systematic temporal sequences—for example whether concepts first become central within their original community and subsequently diffuse across disciplines, or whether some concepts emerge directly at the intersection of several communities.
Additional analysis -- explaining why the strongest indicators work. If one or more measures prove particularly robust, perform a detailed network analysis of what they are capturing. Identify which periods, network neighborhoods, edge types, communities, or structural transitions generate the signal. Representative concept case studies should be selected from the quantitative results and used to visualize these mechanisms.
Optional extension -- learned emergence model. Instead of relying exclusively on individual predefined metrics, train a small interpretable model using temporal network features to predict future emergence or diffusion outcomes. Compare it with the strongest individual indicators on the same held-out evaluation set. If the learned model performs substantially better, analyze which network features and temporal patterns it uses and whether these patterns have a meaningful interpretation in terms of scientific knowledge evolution.
Expected outcome
The expected outcome is not merely a list or ranking of emerging scientific concepts, but a validated framework for identifying and explaining scientific emergence through temporal network structure. The study should determine which network signals are robust across scientific domains, which signals are domain-specific, and how concepts transition from local research topics to broadly connected elements of the scientific knowledge network. 
We expect the final result as publication in the specific journal format mentioned above, in the structure that other papers from this journal have, with citations from the related work from the selected journal, with comparison to the related work. For each research question we would like to have experimental setup, comparison to related work if available, produced results and discussed outcomes. We would also like to have a general methodology presented in graphical form and clearly explained in the paper. Use the following API key for OpenAlex: q0jD2k15XbNV0E3SFHhpr0
