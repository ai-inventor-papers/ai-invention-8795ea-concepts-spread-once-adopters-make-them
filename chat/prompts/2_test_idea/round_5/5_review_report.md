### [1] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-29 08:40:42 UTC

<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: An adversarial paper reviewer (Step 3.5: REVIEW_REPORT in the invention loop)

You received a paper draft written by a DIFFERENT model. Review it with fresh eyes.
Provide constructive but rigorous critique that will improve the next iteration.

Specific critiques → better paper. Vague praise → no improvement.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

ROLE: You are a very experienced and critical researcher auditing a colleague's research
record. Your expertise spans the domain of the work under review, and you have reviewed for
top-tier venues in it — but that is not what you are doing here.

WHAT YOU ARE REVIEWING: the run's INTERNAL RESEARCH REPORT, not a paper. It is a lab
notebook written up: chronological, one section per iteration, complete. Its job is to
preserve everything the run did and concluded, including the parts that failed. A separate
step writes the publishable paper at the end, out of this report, and it can draw only on
what it finds here.

TASK: Audit the record. Is every result that exists written down, in full? Can each number
be traced to the artifact that produced it? Does the report say what was learned, what was
ruled out, and why the run moved where it did?

FIGURES: The report contains figure specifications with captions and descriptions but the
actual images have not been generated yet. Assume each figure shows exactly what its
caption describes — do not penalize for missing images.

ARTIFACTS: The report references code artifacts via [ARTIFACT:id] markers. The correct
URLs to the artifact folders will be added later — do not penalize for missing links.

GOAL: Your review feeds back to the report's author and steers the next iteration. Spend it
on what would most improve the RECORD: a missing experiment write-up, a table left out, a
number nobody can trace, reasoning that was never written down, a dead end that vanished.
Do not spend it on presentation, framing or novelty — those belong to a document that has
not been written yet.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES: Provide a thorough assessment touching on each of these:
(a) Completeness: Is every experiment the run executed written up, with its tables in
    full? A result that exists in an artifact workspace and not in the report is the
    defect this review exists to catch. Are dead ends recorded as dead ends rather than
    quietly dropped?
(b) Traceability: Can each number, table and claim be followed back to the artifact that
    produced it — an [ARTIFACT:id] marker, a named output file, a workspace path? Could a
    reader re-run what is described and get the same thing?
(c) What was learned: Does the report say what the evidence now supports, what it rules
    out, and why the run changed course when it did? Is the reasoning behind each
    iteration recorded, or only its outcome?
(d) Honesty: Are the limits of the evidence stated plainly, without selling? Does any claim
    outrun what actually ran?

SUPPLEMENTARY SCORES: Rate each on a 1-4 scale.
Soundness (1-4) — soundness of the technical claims and of the experimental methodology as the
report describes it, and whether every claim is supported by evidence that ran:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Presentation (1-4) — quality of writing, clarity, and contextualization relative to prior work:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor
Contribution (1-4) — how much of the run this report actually preserves: every experiment and table
recorded, every step's reasoning captured, every dead end kept with its evidence:
  4: excellent  3: good  2: fair  1: poor

OVERALL SCORE (1-10):
  10 — Award quality: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on one or more
       areas of the field, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility,
       and resources, and no unaddressed concerns.
   9 — Very Strong Accept: Technically flawless with groundbreaking impact on at least
       one area and excellent impact on multiple areas, with flawless evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   8 — Strong Accept: Technically strong with novel ideas, excellent impact on at least
       one area or high-to-excellent impact on multiple areas, with excellent evaluation,
       resources, and reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   7 — Accept: Technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area or
       moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation,
       resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed concerns.
   6 — Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns
       with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility.
   5 — Borderline Accept: Technically solid where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to
       reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Use sparingly.
   4 — Borderline Reject: Technically solid where reasons to reject, e.g., limited
       evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept. Use sparingly.
   3 — Reject: For instance, technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility.
   2 — Strong Reject: For instance, major technical flaws, poor evaluation, limited
       impact, poor reproducibility.
   1 — Very Strong Reject: For instance, trivial results or unaddressed concerns.

CONFIDENCE (1-5):
  5: Absolutely certain. Very familiar with related work, checked details carefully.
  4: Confident but not absolutely certain. Unlikely you misunderstood something.
  3: Fairly confident. Possible you missed some related work or details.
  2: Willing to defend your assessment, but quite likely missed central aspects.
  1: Educated guess. Not in your area or difficult to evaluate.

For each dimension, provide a list of specific improvements:
- WHAT needs to change
- HOW to change it (concrete enough for the author to act on immediately)
- EXPECTED SCORE IMPACT: how much would fixing this raise the overall score?

REVIEW PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific and actionable — vague critique is useless
- Ground your review in evidence — search for existing work, accepted papers, known results
- Rank critiques by score impact — address the biggest score blockers first
- Distinguish major issues (the record is incomplete or untraceable) from minor issues (polish)
- Acknowledge genuine strengths — don't be negative for its own sake
- Compare against the bar set by accepted papers at top-tier venues
- Check COMPLETENESS artifact by artifact. Walk the supplementary materials and, for each executed artifact, find where the report reports it. An artifact whose results are absent, or summarised without its table, is a major issue: the paper step writes from this report alone and cannot publish what is not here
- Check every TABLE is present with its actual numbers. Open the output files and compare. Prose like "performance improved" standing in for a table that exists on disk is a major issue
- Check TRACEABILITY: each number, table and claim carries an [ARTIFACT:id] marker or names the output file it came from. An untraceable number is a major issue even when it is correct
- Check the REASONING is recorded, not just the outcomes: why each strategy, why these artifacts, what the previous review objected to, what the hypothesis update concluded and why it moved. A section that reports results with no account of why they were sought is incomplete
- Check DEAD ENDS are kept and labelled, with the evidence that killed them. A direction the run abandoned and the report does not mention is a major issue: it makes the run look luckier than it was, and the paper step will never know the alternative was tried
- Check the CHRONOLOGY holds: one section per iteration, in order, and the earlier sections unchanged except where a correction is marked in place. An earlier section silently rewritten destroys the record and is a major issue
- Check that every headline number came out of an artifact that ACTUALLY RAN, and RECOMPUTE it yourself from that artifact's own tables or result files — do not accept the report's figure on its word. A mismatch between what you recompute and what the report states is a finding in its own right. Where an artifact does not let you recompute a number, say so and score that claim unverified rather than accepted. A projected, expected, illustrative or placeholder number presented as a result is the most serious defect this report can have — set results_reported false and blocking true
- When the report claims a POSITIVE, non-obvious result, name the nearest published result that already answers something close to it and state what this iteration adds beyond that neighbour. This checks whether the FINDING has earned its claim, not how the paper will be framed against the literature: a positive result gets no credit for novelty in this record until that comparison is made, and its absence is a critique under 'novelty'
- Check for an iteration that added METRICS rather than SAMPLES to an already underpowered panel. When a power analysis or the effect sizes on record show the artifact panel cannot detect the effect being chased, more candidate metrics or readouts over the same panel do not fix that — flag it as a major issue and say the budget belonged on more graded samples or checkpoints instead
- Check COVERAGE against the user's ORIGINAL request, not against the report's own framing. Name the part of the request the run has not addressed yet
- Check that claims are PROPORTIONATE to the evidence. A small, expected-direction effect written up as the answer is the failure mode to name explicitly
- Do NOT review this as a paper. Section order, narrative arc, abstract framing, figure count and writing polish are the later paper step's concerns, and a critique about them spends the run's iteration budget on the wrong document. The nearest-neighbour check above is different: it asks whether the record has earned its positive claim, not how the paper will be sold against the literature. Bookkeeping — run ids, timestamps, spend, review scores, file hashes — BELONGS in this report; never ask for its removal

<available_tools>
Web research is available through the aii-web-tools skill, in three levels (broad → specific):

1. web search — Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Use first to discover and scan the landscape. Two modes: general (default, broad web) and scholarly (peer-reviewed papers + citations) — pass mode=scholarly for prior-art, related-work, and citation lookups.
2. web fetch — Reads a page and returns its content as markdown (HTML or PDF). Use to understand a source. May miss specific details — use fetch_grep below if it doesn't find what you need.
3. fetch_grep — Regex search over a page/PDF's full text. Returns exact matching sections with context. Use for precise details, exact numbers, methodology, or PDFs.

Workflow: search → fetch (understand) → fetch_grep (extract specifics).
</available_tools>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/3_invention_loop/iter_5/review_report/review_report`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/3_invention_loop/iter_5/review_report/review_report/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/3_invention_loop/iter_5/review_report/review_report/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_Id7TLZ6r1C7M/3_invention_loop/iter_5/review_report/review_report/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.

\title{Do temporal network signals predict how scientific concepts spread across disciplines?}

\author{AI Inventor}

\date{}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
New scientific concepts differ sharply in how broadly they spread across disciplines. We ask whether the early structure of a concept's topic cooccurrence network anticipates later cross-field breadth, beyond simple measures of volume and reach. Using the OpenAlex corpus, we identify 12{,}499 concepts, track 27{,}393 adoption episodes across 26 fields, and screen 53 early network indicators against a five-feature popularity baseline. Seven indicators survive held-out validation and compose into an openness index (OPEN) that measures a concept's early tendency to acquire novel, community-spanning cooccurrence partners. On a confirmatory cohort never used in selection, OPEN predicts size-adjusted breadth with partial Spearman correlation +0.17 (95\% CI [+0.09, +0.25]). The signal is topical non-redundancy of the home neighbourhood, not temporal partner turnover: a within-concept permutation null absorbs the year-to-year churn, while the signal survives rarefaction and degree-preserving configuration nulls. Separately, a conditional logit on field-entry events confirms that concepts spread next to fields related to the ones currently retaining them, extending the principle of relatedness from economic complexity. These results suggest that the diversity of a concept's early intellectual neighbourhood, not its stability, distinguishes concepts destined for broad disciplinary integration.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Some scientific concepts remain confined to their home discipline for decades, while others cross field boundaries within a few years. Optogenetics, born in neuroscience, entered genetics, psychiatry and bioengineering; deep learning, rooted in computer science, now appears in medicine, materials science and linguistics. Understanding what distinguishes broadly spreading concepts from locally absorbed ones matters for science policy, research evaluation and the design of interdisciplinary programmes \citep{Rafols2009,Hofstra2019}. If early structural signals predict later cross-field integration, funders and institutions could identify concepts with high diffusion potential before that diffusion is observable in publication counts alone.

The problem is hard because simple popularity metrics (publication volume, growth rate, share of papers outside the home field) already explain much of the variance in later breadth \citep{Rotolo2015,Singh2021}. Any network indicator must add information \emph{beyond} these baselines. Prior work has proposed several candidate signals, including community diversity of early adopters \citep{Weng2013}, collaboration density before emergence \citep{Salatino2017}, and structural variation in citation networks \citep{Salatino2018}. However, these studies typically operate on curated concept sets without held-out validation, mix concept-level and field-level units of analysis, or do not control for simple volume-based predictors. No prior study has screened a broad set of temporal knowledge-network indicators against a shared baseline on held-out field groups for the specific outcome of size-adjusted cross-disciplinary breadth.

A second open question concerns the routes by which concepts move between fields. The principle of relatedness, established for regional economic diversification \citep{Hidalgo2007,Neffke2011,Pinheiro2021}, predicts that actors diversify into activities related to their existing portfolio. For scientific fields adopting new concepts, this principle has been tested for entry \citep{Hidalgo2018} but not for the role of currently \emph{retaining} fields, those that have adopted a concept and kept publishing on it. Whether concepts spread next to fields related to the ones currently retaining them, beyond relatedness to the home field alone, is untested.

This paper addresses both questions with a large-scale empirical study. We identify 12{,}499 concepts from the OpenAlex bulk snapshot (476 million works, 2026-09-23), compute 53 early network indicators across six families, and test them on held-out field groups and a confirmatory onset cohort [ARTIFACT:art_dFQ6jbgNsR6Q]. We also build a conditional logit model of field entry that tests whether retained-field relatedness predicts the next field a concept enters [ARTIFACT:art_Vu7gHKQXfL53].

\subsection*{Summary of contributions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We screen 53 early cooccurrence network indicators against a five-feature popularity baseline and confirm seven on held-out field groups for predicting rarefied cross-field breadth (Section~\ref{sec:rq1}).
    \item We introduce the OPEN index, a six-component composite of early cooccurrence openness, and confirm it on a 2015--2016 cohort never used in any selection step (Section~\ref{sec:open}).
    \item We show that early neighbourhood consolidation, measured by Cheng et al.'s (2023) ideational consistency, predicts volume growth but \emph{narrower} cross-field reach, a reversal that holds in all five field groups (Section~\ref{sec:cheng}).
    \item We confirm that concepts spread next to fields related to the ones currently retaining them ($d = 0.32$), extending the principle of relatedness (Section~\ref{sec:rq2}).
    \item We decompose breadth into exploration and retention channels and show that early contact diversity accounts for 73\% of the breadth gap (Section~\ref{sec:decomp}).
    \item We demonstrate that the openness--breadth association is topical non-redundancy, not temporal partner turnover (Section~\ref{sec:confound}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related}

\textbf{Concept diffusion in science.} Cheng et al.\ (2023) tracked roughly 2{,}000 new ideas across Web of Science fields and found that early social reach, the number of disconnected researcher groups adopting an idea, was the strongest predictor of whether an idea became ``core.'' Their ideational consistency measure predicted next-year volume. \citet{Rotolo2015} defined emerging technologies through five attributes including novelty and fast growth but did not test cross-field spread. \citet{Salatino2017} showed that collaboration density rises before topic emergence. \citet{Krenn2019} forecast research trends from semantic networks. \citet{Singh2021} quantified the rise and fall of scientific fields using publication trajectories. None of these studies screened a broad indicator set against a shared baseline with held-out validation for the specific outcome of size-adjusted cross-field breadth.

\textbf{Topic cooccurrence and citation networks.} \citet{Callon1991} introduced coword analysis as a tool for mapping the structure of research. \citet{Chavalarias2013} used phylomemetic methods to track how scientific fields branch and merge. \citet{Salatino2018} proposed the AUGUR system for forecasting topic emergence from cooccurrence backbone dynamics. Citation homophily across fields exceeds chance but has not been decomposed into background and concept-specific terms. \citet{Holmgren2023} tracked change in higher-order overlapping community structure in bibliometric networks.

\textbf{Novelty, recombination and impact.} \citet{Uzzi2013} found that high-impact papers combine conventional and atypical journal pairings. \citet{Hofstra2019} documented the diversity--innovation paradox in science: researchers from underrepresented groups produce more novel work but receive fewer citations. \citet{Foster2013} distinguished tradition and innovation strategies in science. \citet{Tria2013} modelled the dynamics of correlated novelties, showing that novelty begets novelty through what they call the ``adjacent possible,'' the set of combinations reachable from the current state of knowledge. These studies operate at the paper level; ours operates at the concept level and asks about cross-field \emph{breadth} rather than citation impact.

\textbf{The principle of relatedness.} \citet{Hidalgo2007} showed that a country's position in the product space predicts which products it diversifies into. \citet{Neffke2011} extended this to regional industry diversification, and \citet{Rigby2015} to knowledge space entry and exit. \citet{Hidalgo2018} formalised the principle of relatedness. \citet{Pinheiro2021} required sustained presence for diversification events. \citet{Bahar2014} showed that countries adopt products exported by their neighbours, a knowledge-diffusion channel for relatedness. Our contribution is to test whether relatedness to the set of fields currently \emph{retaining} a concept predicts entry, beyond relatedness to the home field and conventional density measures.

\textbf{Community structure and virality.} \citet{Weng2013} showed that early community diversity predicts virality of online content (AUC 0.83). \citet{Ugander2012} found that structural diversity, defined as the number of connected components among an adopter's neighbours who have adopted, drives social contagion on Facebook. \citet{Centola2010} demonstrated experimentally that complex contagions require reinforcement from multiple communities. \citet{Palla2007} tracked the evolution of overlapping communities in large networks. \citet{Burt2004} showed that structural holes, brokerage positions spanning disconnected groups, generate good ideas. Our indicator screen tests the scholarly analogue of these mechanisms: whether a concept's early cooccurrence partners spanning multiple communities predicts later cross-field breadth.

\section{Data and methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Concept identification and panel construction}

We use the OpenAlex bulk snapshot (2026-09-23; 476{,}196{,}327 works; 129.4 million base works 1995--2022). Concepts are identified by Aho--Corasick title matching of 56{,}643 legacy OpenAlex concepts (levels 2--5) plus Wikidata aliases, with stemmed verification [ARTIFACT:art_dFQ6jbgNsR6Q]. A per-concept LLM precision gate drops concepts with precision below 0.80.

A concept's \emph{onset year} $t_0$ is the first year it reaches 20 grounded publications. \emph{Home field(s)} are the field(s) holding at least 40\% of the first 30 grounded papers. The specification was frozen on DEV data (hash-sealed before held-out scoring) and unsealed once. The panel comprises 12{,}499 concepts and 27{,}393 concept-by-field adoption episodes (Table~\ref{tab:panel}).

\begin{table}[ht]

DEV (CS/Eng/BGM/Med, onset 2003--2009) & 4{,}771 & 9{,}079 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Outcome: rarefied field breadth}

The primary outcome is \emph{rarefied field breadth} $O_{2r}$ ($m = 50$): the expected number of distinct venue fields among a fixed-size random draw of $m$ papers from a concept's publications in years $t_0 + 6$ to $t_0 + 8$, computed by exact hypergeometric rarefaction. Rarefaction separates size-adjusted breadth from sheer volume: a concept with 10{,}000 papers in one field scores lower than a concept with 200 papers spread across six fields. Secondary outcomes include sustained uptake ($O_{1c}$, binary: concept still active at $t_0 + 8$), transience ($O_3$, binary: concept drops below 5 papers by $t_0 + 8$), and field- and year-normalised citation growth ($O_4$).

[FIGURE:fig_outcomes]

\subsection{Baseline and indicator families}

We define a \emph{five-feature baseline} consisting of log early volume, publication growth, non-home share, Shannon entropy and field reach, all computed over $t_0$ to $t_0 + 2$. The 53 candidate indicators span six families: cooccurrence ego-network topology (27 indicators: degree, density, persistence, novelty, community counts), popularity and volume (6), disciplinary spread (3), retained frontier (7: contact reach, retention ratio, densities), gateway centrality on the field backbone (7), and coauthor reach (3).

\subsection{The OPEN index}

The OPEN index is the mean of six signed $z$-scored ego-network components from the early window ($t_0$ to $t_0 + 2$):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item New edge rate (positive sign): the fraction of a concept's cooccurrence neighbours that are new.
    \item Number of Leiden communities reached ($n_{\text{comm}}$, positive): how many distinct topic communities a concept's neighbours span.
    \item Participation coefficient (positive): the share of a concept's ties that cross community boundaries.
    \item Neighbourhood novelty residual (NOV$_{\text{res}}$, positive): the novelty of a concept's cooccurrence partners after residualising on degree.
    \item Ego density (negative sign): the density of the concept's local cooccurrence subgraph.
    \item Edge persistence (negative sign): the fraction of the concept's neighbours retained across windows.
\end{enumerate}

The $z$-score constants are frozen from the DEV data. We test three builds: OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ (home-field cooccurrence graph only), OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ (corpus-wide graph), and OPEN$_{\text{sizematch}}$ (corpus-wide papers subsampled to home counts).

\subsection{Statistical framework}

Indicator screening uses \emph{partial Spearman priority} (PSP): the Pearson correlation of rank-transformed indicator and outcome residuals, both residualised on the baseline covariates and control rungs. Inference uses 2{,}000 concept-level bootstrap resamples with refit [ARTIFACT:art_dFQ6jbgNsR6Q]. Pooling across field groups uses the DerSimonian--Laird random-effects estimator \citep{Dersimonian1986} with $I^2$ heterogeneity reporting \citep{Higgins2002}. Multiple comparisons use Holm correction across the pre-declared family.

We also define NOVCHURN as the mean of $z$(NOV$_{\text{res}}$) and $-z$(edge persistence), a two-component novelty/churn measure used in mechanism analyses.

For the field-entry analysis, we use a conditional logit on concept-year risk sets, where each concept-year stratum includes all non-home fields not yet entered, and the event is entry (at least 2 cumulative grounded papers). The entry baseline includes relatedness to home, log field size, density over all ever-entered fields, and the target field's own eigenvector centrality on the topic-relatedness backbone.

\subsection{Held-out indicator screen}

The top 10 indicators selected on DEV by partial Spearman priority were tested once on four held-out field groups and two cohort splits [ARTIFACT:art_dFQ6jbgNsR6Q]. Seven are confirmed with $p < 0.05$ after Holm correction for multiple comparisons and 95\% CI excluding zero (Table~\ref{tab:screen}).

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Held-out indicator screen: the 10 indicators with highest DEV partial Spearman priority for rarefied breadth ($O_{2r}$, $m = 50$), tested on held-out groups. DerSimonian--Laird pooled estimates with 95\% CI. Confirmed indicators (Holm $p < 0.05$ and CI excluding zero) are marked.}
\label{tab:screen}
\small
\begin{tabular}{llccccc}
\toprule

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The confirmed indicators span two families: relatedness (end-of-window field density, volume-weighted field density, contact reach, retention ratio) and cooccurrence topology (community count, neighbourhood novelty residual, ego density). No centrality or volume-only indicator survives. Two confirmed indicators carry negative signs: the early retention ratio (concepts with higher early field retention spread \emph{less} broadly) and ego density (concepts with denser cooccurrence neighbourhoods spread less).

An ElasticNet combining all indicators adds Spearman +0.059 [+0.046, +0.073] over the five-feature baseline on held-out groups; an Explainable Boosting Machine adds +0.052 [+0.037, +0.067].

[FIGURE:fig_rq1_confirmed]

\subsection{Pre-onset footprint}
\label{sec:footprint}

We define a concept's \emph{pre-onset footprint} as the publication presence of its name in fields other than the home field before its onset year $t_0$. About half of the end-of-window field density and volume-weighted field density signal comes from this footprint. On held-out data, the postonset-only field density drops from +0.374 to +0.187 [+0.145, +0.246] and the volume-weighted variant drops from +0.317 to +0.176 [+0.114, +0.227]. The postonset components remain clearly positive, but these indicators are partly legacy presence, not purely early network dynamics.

[FIGURE:fig_full_screen]

\subsection{Confirmatory cohort test of the OPEN index}
\label{sec:open}

The OPEN index was confirmed on a 2015--2016 onset cohort never used in any prior screen [ARTIFACT:art_dFQ6jbgNsR6Q]. We define a six-rung \emph{control ladder} that tests OPEN's partial Spearman with rarefied breadth under increasingly demanding baselines (Table~\ref{tab:ladder}). Each rung adds a covariate set: the first rung adds the five-feature baseline plus onset year; subsequent rungs add contact reach, concept type, pre-onset footprint, label coverage and home-group fixed effects, in that order.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{OPEN index control ladder on the 2015--2016 confirmatory cohort. PSP = partial Spearman priority with rarefied breadth ($O_{2r}$, $m = 50$), 95\% concept-bootstrap CI.}
\label{tab:ladder}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}
\toprule
Build & R0 & R1 & R2 & R3 & R4 & R5 & $n$ \\
\midrule
OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ & \small{+.12} & \small{+.10} & \small{+.09} & \small{+.08} & \small{+.07} & \small{+.06} & 573 \\
OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ & \small{+.21} & \small{+.18} & \small{+.17} & \small{+.17} & \small{+.15} & \small{+.14} & 630 \\
OPEN$_{\text{size}}$ & \small{+.18} & \small{+.15} & \small{+.15} & \small{+.14} & \small{+.12} & \small{+.11} & 591 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ and OPEN$_{\text{sizematch}}$ survive all six rungs with confidence intervals excluding zero. OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ passes the primary concept-type rung (PSP = +0.091, 95\% CI [+0.013, +0.171]) but its DerSimonian--Laird pooled interval includes zero (+0.083 [$-$0.007, +0.173]), making the home-only signal marginal. The paired difference OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ minus OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ at the footprint rung is +0.093 [+0.016, +0.169], confirming that cross-field cooccurrence carries information beyond home-field structure.

A specification curve across 1{,}920 specifications (120 composites $\times$ 4 outcomes $\times$ 4 control sets) shows 99.7\% of specifications with confidence intervals above zero (permutation $p$ = 0.005).

[FIGURE:fig_open_ladder]

\subsection{Vocabulary-free confirmation (Frame~N)}

To address survivorship bias in the legacy concept vocabulary, we mined 636 vocabulary-free phrase-born concepts from random title samples (2003--2015 onsets), excluding all legacy labels and previously scored concepts [ARTIFACT:art_XRz1kLvWbXnO]. These vocabulary-free newborns have 14\% lower breadth and 89\% higher transience than legacy concepts, confirming that curated vocabularies are survivor-selected.

On these newborns, OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ gives PSP +0.117 [+0.020, +0.218] at the pre-onset footprint rung for $O_{2r}$ ($m = 30$). The signal is carried primarily by neighbourhood novelty: the novelty residual alone gives +0.208 [+0.113, +0.303], while edge persistence is null ($-$0.013). Pooling the independent Frame~N result with the legacy cohort, weighted by the inverse of each estimate's variance, gives +0.096 [+0.034, +0.158] at the footprint rung.

[FIGURE:fig_frame_n]

\subsection{The consistency--breadth reversal}
\label{sec:cheng}

Cheng et al.'s (2023) ideational consistency is the cosine similarity of a concept's neighbour co-usage vector from year $t-1$ to $t$. We rebuilt the measure on OpenAlex topic co-usage for 12{,}311 concepts (105{,}839 concept-years) [ARTIFACT:art_JwxcRvqfaD5z]. In their design (next-year volume, no current-size control), the negative-binomial model reproduces their estimate: $b = 0.428$ (+53.5\%/SD). Adding current volume log $V(t)$ removes almost all of it: +1.3\% [+0.5\%, +2.1\%], a residual-to-raw ratio of 0.021 [0.009, 0.035]. The volume effect is almost entirely a proxy for current size.

As an early trait, consistency predicts \emph{narrower} cross-field reach. Net of the five-feature baseline, the partial Spearman with rarefied breadth is $-$0.069 [$-$0.093, $-$0.047] on the pooled bodies (DerSimonian--Laird over five field groups: $-$0.079, $I^2$ = 0.00, 5/5 groups negative), replicating on the 2015--2017 cohort ($-$0.111 [$-$0.197, $-$0.030]). The consistency measure has Spearman +0.79 with edge persistence; it is essentially weighted persistence, confirming that a stable neighbourhood predicts growth but not breadth.

[FIGURE:fig_cheng_reversal]

\section{Results: field entry and trajectories}
\label{sec:rq2}

\subsection{Retained-field relatedness predicts the next field entered}

A conditional logit on concept-year risk sets tests whether relatedness to the fields currently retaining a concept predicts which field it enters next [ARTIFACT:art_Vu7gHKQXfL53]. We define a field as ``retaining'' a concept when it has published at least two grounded papers on the concept in each of the two most recent years. Relatedness between fields is measured by pointwise mutual information (PMI) of topic coassignment on the field-level backbone.

On an independent frame of 11{,}841 concepts (6{,}978 entry events in 6{,}076 informative strata), the pooled held-out standardised coefficient is $d_0$ = 0.322 [0.291, 0.355] with LR = 325.8 ($p < 10^{-70}$). The effect is substantial but heterogeneous across field families: Life \& Environment shows the strongest signal (+0.401) and Mathematics \& Decision Sciences is null (+0.065). DerSimonian--Laird pooled $d_0$ = 0.243 [0.118, 0.368], $I^2$ = 0.92.

Retained-field relatedness survives both the conventional revealed-comparative-advantage density ($D_{\text{rca}}$) and a share-weighted current presence density: adding $d_0$ after both rivals gives LR = 29.3 ($p = 6.1 \times 10^{-8}$) on DEV, and $D_{\text{rca}}$ is absorbed once $d_0$ enters. All three specificity tests reject their nulls after Holm correction. A dose-response by retention age shows a monotone pattern (2 years: +0.056; 3 years: +0.103; $\geq$4 years: +0.251).

However, the volume-matched contrast is null on held-out data (Holm $p$ = 0.76), and the effect is backbone-specific: under minimum conditional probability proximity instead of PMI, $d_0 = -0.021$. We cannot fully separate persistence from sustained volume as a predictor of field entry.

[FIGURE:fig_field_entry]

\subsection{Gateway centrality does not predict field retention}

An initial 80-episode panel suggested that a field's eigenvector centrality on the topic-relatedness backbone predicts retention ($\Delta$AUC +0.103) [ARTIFACT:art_33_KKk_G8Gw5]. On the full panel of 27{,}393 episodes, gateway centrality adds $\Delta$AUC $-$0.00001 (95\% CI [$-$0.0006, +0.0003]) [ARTIFACT:art_Vu7gHKQXfL53]. The signal vanishes once the field's leave-concept-out retention propensity is controlled. The shuffled-$R$ placebo's 95th percentile (0.130) exceeds the original +0.103, so the original lead cannot be certified as above chance on 80 episodes.

\section{Breadth decomposition and mechanism}
\label{sec:decomp}

\subsection{Exploration drives breadth, not retention}

Rarefied breadth $B_n$ can be decomposed as $\log B_n = \log E_2 + \log M + \log \rho$, where $E_2$ is early contact diversity (number of fields reached in the first three years), $M$ is the frontier advance ratio (new fields entered after the early window), and $\rho$ is the retention rate (fraction of early-contact fields that remain active). On 3{,}188 DEV concepts [ARTIFACT:art_Vu7gHKQXfL53]:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Breadth decomposition ($\log B_n = \log E_2 + \log M + \log \rho$): share of the top-versus-bottom tercile gap in rarefied breadth attributable to each component.}
\label{tab:decomp}
\small
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Component & Share & 95\% CI \\
\midrule
Exploration ($s_{\text{E2}} + s_M$) & 0.732 & [0.703, 0.764] \\
\quad Early contact diversity ($s_{\text{E2}}$) & 0.779 & [0.738, 0.818] \\
Retention ($s_\rho$) & 0.268 & [0.236, 0.297] \\
Difference (explore $-$ retain) & 0.464 & [0.407, 0.528] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Broad concepts start with wider contact, not by advancing a wider frontier: the frontier advance component is negative ($s_M = -0.046$ [$-$0.074, $-$0.017]).

[FIGURE:fig_decomp]

\subsection{Which partners carry the signal?}
\label{sec:confound}

The home-only signal is carried by partners from new Leiden communities that arrive through mixed-field papers, those with at least one off-home topic [ARTIFACT:art_jHxmVyMKP0KN]. In a Shapley decomposition of the NOVCHURN partial Spearman:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Partners from new communities carry the signal (contrast $C_2$ = +0.102 [+0.069, +0.133], Holm $p$ = 0.003).
    \item Partners carried by mixed-field papers carry the signal ($C_4$ = +0.103 [+0.071, +0.134], Holm $p$ = 0.003).
    \item Novelty among substantive-domain partners, not among methodological partners, is the main contributor (domain Shapley $\phi$ = +0.132 on the 2015--2017 cohort, method = +0.012).
\end{itemize}

We call a home paper that introduces at least one cooccurrence partner from a previously unrepresented Leiden community a \emph{bridging paper}. Controlling for the share of early home papers that are bridging papers halves the NOVCHURN partial from 0.118 to 0.056. These bridging papers have more first-time authors on the concept (+5 percentage points) and far more off-home topics (+25 points).

[FIGURE:fig_mechanism]

\subsection{Topical non-redundancy, not temporal turnover}

Raw edge persistence has Spearman +0.72 with log home-paper count [ARTIFACT:art_gq9S7nAtWrUT]. We tested three confound-correction variants:

\textbf{Fixed-size rarefaction.} Subsampling to 10 home papers per year retains 68\% of the pooled association. The bias-corrected Chao estimator of the Jaccard index retains 91\%.

\textbf{Within-concept permutation null.} The excess churn over a 200-draw within-concept year-label permutation null is indistinguishable from zero: excess NOVCHURN pooled PSP = +0.008 [$-$0.02, +0.03], compared to raw NOVCHURN = +0.116 [+0.09, +0.14]. The $R^2$ of raw persistence on this permutation-null mean is 0.66. What predicts breadth is a static property, the non-redundancy of the concept's home-topic partner mix, not year-to-year turnover.

\textbf{Degree-preserving configuration null.} Replacing raw ego density and persistence by their curveball configuration $z$-scores raises OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ from +0.092 to +0.115 on the same sample.

Split-half reliability of NOVCHURN$_{\text{raw}}$ is 0.48, rising to 0.67 at $\geq$100 home papers. The disattenuated pooled NOVCHURN$_{\text{raw}}$ PSP is 0.178 [0.141, 0.214].

[FIGURE:fig_confound]

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

\subsection{What the OPEN index captures}

The OPEN index captures the degree to which a concept's early neighbourhood acquires partners from diverse communities rather than reinforcing existing ones. The signal is not temporal turnover but topical non-redundancy. A within-concept permutation null absorbs the year-to-year component, yet the association persists: concepts whose home-field cooccurrence partners span many communities and arrive through papers with off-home topics tend to reach more fields later. This is consistent with \citet{March1991}'s exploration--exploitation distinction at the concept level: concepts embedded in a diverse, open intellectual neighbourhood are better positioned for cross-field diffusion than those embedded in a dense, self-referential one.

The home-only signal (OPEN$_{\text{home}}$) is marginal. The stronger OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ signal is partly mechanically coupled: early off-home papers that enter the ego network are a subset of the papers that determine the outcome. OPEN$_{\text{sizematch}}$ (corpus-wide papers subsampled to home counts) controls for this coupling and remains significant.

\subsection{The consistency--breadth reversal}

Cheng et al.\ (2023) found that ideational consistency predicts a concept becoming ``core.'' We replicate their result for volume (+53\%/SD) but show that, net of volume, the same property predicts \emph{narrower} cross-field reach. The reversal holds in all five field groups ($I^2 = 0$), replicates on a fresh cohort, and is a between-concept trait (within concepts, a more consistent year is followed by slightly \emph{more} entries). The features predictive of local consolidation and growth (stable terminology, consistent co-usage patterns) are distinct from, and partly opposed to, the features predictive of broad disciplinary spread. This distinction matters for policy: a concept ``becoming core'' in the sense of rising in volume and stable terminology may be deepening within its home community rather than spreading across fields.

\subsection{Background homophily in citation lineage}

A methodological finding from the lineage analysis merits attention [ARTIFACT:art_xp8BGBJZsxeI]. Among 48 concepts in the citation-lineage experiment, 100\% have a positive background log-odds ratio: every field's citing papers preferentially cite their own field above chance. The $R^2$ of the raw concept-lineage log-odds ratio on the background log-odds ratio is 0.66 (90\% CI [0.39, 0.83]). Two-thirds of the between-concept variance in raw lineage autonomy is general disciplinary homophily, not concept-specific integration. Uniform-null lineage indices conflate field composition with concept-specific rooting. This extends \citet{Lipsitch2010}'s negative-control framework from epidemiology to bibliometric mixing tables.

\subsection{Retained-field relatedness}

The confirmed field-entry result ($d_0 = 0.32$ on the independent frame) extends the principle of relatedness from economic complexity \citep{Hidalgo2007,Neffke2011} to concept adoption. No prior study has tested whether relatedness to the set of fields currently \emph{retaining} a concept predicts entry, beyond relatedness to the home field. The result is partial: the volume-matched contrast is null, and the effect is backbone-specific. But $d_0$ survives both the conventional density and a volume-density rival, with a monotone dose-response by retention age.

\subsection{Limitations}

\textbf{Effect size.} The OPEN--breadth association is modest. OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ adds no forecasting gain over the five-feature baseline (+0.002 [$-$0.003, +0.008]). The cross-validated Spearman of the baseline alone is 0.79; adding all indicators raises it by about 0.03. The practical predictive gain from early network structure is small.

\textbf{Measurement noise.} Split-half reliability of OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ is 0.49. The signal is measured with substantial noise at typical sample sizes (median $\sim$30 home papers in the early window). Prediction for individual concepts remains imprecise.

\textbf{Vocabulary bias.} The legacy OpenAlex concept vocabulary is survivor-selected. The Frame~N panel is small (448 concepts), with pre-unseal power of only 0.47.

\textbf{Cooccurrence, not causation.} Early ego-network openness could reflect the concept's intrinsic generality, the diversity of the research community around it, or the breadth of the problems it addresses. We show association, not mechanism.

\textbf{Domain heterogeneity.} Life \& Environment Sciences show the weakest OPEN signal (PSP +0.071 vs.\ +0.186 for the other five units pooled). The retained-field relatedness effect has $I^2 = 0.92$, indicating substantial cross-domain heterogeneity.

\section{Conclusion}

We screened 53 early temporal network indicators for predicting the cross-disciplinary breadth of new scientific concepts, using 12{,}499 concepts from the OpenAlex corpus with held-out validation. Seven indicators are confirmed, composing into an openness index that captures topical non-redundancy in a concept's early cooccurrence neighbourhood. Early openness predicts breadth; early consolidation predicts volume but not breadth. Concepts spread next to fields related to those currently retaining them, extending the principle of relatedness.

The practical forecasting gain from early network structure is small next to simple popularity baselines. The conceptual contribution, however, is that openness and consolidation have opposing associations with breadth and volume. This clarifies that growing deeper within a home discipline and spreading wider across disciplines are not the same process, and the network signatures that predict one do not predict the other.

summary: |-
  Screen of candidate L, the background-adjusted naturalisation gap A*_h, on the frozen P78 dev panel. Headline: it does NOT survive the pre-registered rule.
  PANEL: 48 dev concepts (Biochem 13, CS 21, Engineering 3, Medicine 11). Dropped: 22 with t0 outside 2003-2009 and 8 with a sealed home field.
  RULE CLAUSES:
  - LOGO Delta-rho for O2r over B5 = -0.006, 90% concept-bootstrap CI [-0.034, 0.017]; rho_B5 = 0.834. FAIL.
  - Positive left-out groups: 0 of 4. FAIL.
  - Split-half reliability (Spearman-Brown) = 0.58. FAIL (bar 0.6).
  - Abs Spearman with log early volume / early growth = 0.14 / 0.18. PASS.
  OTHER RESULTS:
  - A*_h's within-field sign flips: Medicine +0.45, CS -0.18.
  - Field-level rho*_cj -> R_j: Delta-AUC +0.002, CI [-0.011, 0.016], over 367 units.
  - O1 uptake: Delta-AUC -0.026. O3 transience is degenerate (4 positives of 48).
  - M1: R^2 of raw lineage log-OR on background log-OR = 0.66; the background log-OR is positive for 48/48 concepts. Raw lineage is mostly homophily.
  - Reliability vs n: 0.72 only above 60 off-home children. On those 11 concepts Delta-rho = +0.118, CI [0, 0.355], underpowered.
  - REML tau_c = 0.29, tau_cj = 0.65. PyMC NUTS check passes (Spearman 0.9996 with REML).
  - None of the 14 candidate and foil features, scored as exploratory candidates, beats B5.
  DATA DEVIATION: the shared OpenAlex credit pool ran dry (139 own credits spent). Yearly counts (t0, O1, O3, volume, growth) are OpenAlex S0 exactly. Field labels, concept papers, citation lineage and background-reference fields come from free Semantic Scholar data: fractional s2-fos text-classifier fields. Child reference lists come from free OpenAlex singleton GETs. The S2 and OpenAlex O2r agree with Spearman 0.87 on 11 concepts.
  AUDIT (audit/rederive.py, independent code paths): Delta-rho, rho_B, the size correlations, O1 Delta-AUC and M1 are re-derived exactly; field-level Delta-AUC is 0.0020. A shuffled-A*_h placebo passes 0 of 200 times. Power caveat: with rho_B5 = 0.83, a feature needs Spearman of about 0.95 or more with O2r to pass the Delta >= 0.10 clause. Reliability 0.58 was NOT independently re-derived.

summary: >-
  Screen of two co-occurrence emergence indicators on the frozen P78 dev panel under shared protocol S0 (47 dev concepts:
  BIO 16, CS 12, MED 10, ENG 9). The shared OpenAlex key was exhausted, so S0 yearly counts (t0, newborn, O1, O3, logvol,
  growth) came from 156 anonymous API credits, and everything else came from a zero-credit column-pruned scan of all 476M
  works in the 2026-09-23 OpenAlex S3 snapshot. Venue-field compositions (home, O2r, R_j, entropy) and ego topics use title-matched
  works (median 48% of API volume; rho 0.88). Backbone: full-corpus topic PMI per slice (2000-04/05-09/10-14), Leiden gamma=3
  (25/26/23 communities; the plan rule gave about 8, reported as D_q). D_z failed the T3 size diagnostic (rho with log volume
  -0.63), so the pre-declared fallback D_ratio is the primary D. RESULTS (LOGO ridge, 2,000 stratified concept bootstraps):
  B5 alone reaches rho 0.770 with O2r. D_ratio delta-rho +0.006 [90% CI -0.092, 0.135], 3/4 groups positive, SB 0.83. F_res
  delta-rho -0.060 [-0.158, 0.014], 1/4 groups positive, SB 0.44. No candidate survives the pre-registered rule; D is carried
  forward as the best available result and the null is reported. Dissociation tests are inconclusive; O3 is not estimable
  (all transient concepts are Medicine); field-level R_j dAUC is about 0. Portability: D_ratio, D_rare, participation and
  NOV_res are associated with O2r in all 4 groups (rho 0.45-0.63) but are redundant under delta-rho. Degree, strength and
  new-edge growth are CS-only (a negative result). EXPLORATORY: the out-of-group partial rho of D_ratio given B5 is 0.335
  [0.02, 0.65], permutation p=0.037; delta-rho is near its ceiling because B5 is already strong. Audit: all headline numbers

  per-group and DerSimonian-Laird Spearman/AUC with I2). RESULTS: 46 dev concepts (34 with an outcome window). Leave-one-home-group-out
  ridge, B5 vs B5+G on O2r: Delta-rho=+0.033, 90% CI [-0.095,0.168], positive in 2/4 groups, so G does NOT survive the pre-registered
  rule, although reliability (r_SB=0.92) and the size check (|rho|<=0.13) pass. Secondary: O2r residualised on log N gives
  Delta-rho=+0.15, CI90 [0.000,0.321], 4/4 groups. O1 Delta-AUC=+0.072, CI90 [0.00,0.16]. O3 is not evaluable (2 positives).
  Field level: the adopting field's gateway centrality adds +0.10 AUC for retention, 95% CI [0.03,0.17], and survives a field-size
  control (not in CS). Next-field entry: relatedness density AUC 0.61 beats the permutation null (p=0.023) but loses to log
  field size (0.74); in conditional logit, density still adds signal. CAVEATS: the shared OpenAlex key hit its 1,000-credit
  floor after 286 credits, so the t0+3..t0+4 labels are missing (label-based B5 parts use t0..t0+2), outcome windows keep
  only the top-200 sources (29/34 truncated), and insularity, SLICE_B and P5 were not computed. The backbone is 1998-2002
  topic co-assignment PMI over 26 fields (field_backbone.json). Cache is frozen in cache/raw.

title: Do hub fields keep new concepts? Held-out test
summary: |-
  Sealed held-out test of H1 (does the adopting field's frozen 1998-2002 eigenvector gateway centrality predict retention of a newly adopted concept beyond B5, field size, phi(home,j), relatedness density, the field's leave-concept-out retention propensity P_j(-c), coverage and episode size?) and H3 (does gateway-weighted early landing G predict size-adjusted breadth O2r_resid given B5?).

  Data: one zero-credit scan of all 2,040 OpenAlex S3 works files (2026-09-23; 476,196,327 works; 129.4M base works 1995-2022), with Aho-Corasick title matching of 56,643 legacy concepts (levels 2-5) plus Wikidata aliases and stemmed verification: 60.0M verified matches. Grounding: legacy-tag rule TAG (test P 0.947, R 0.659), chosen on a 390-pair LLM benchmark with 60 hand-checked pairs (90% agreement), plus a per-concept LLM precision gate ($2.28 of OpenRouter).

  Authoritative S1 tables for iteration 3: frame_concepts.csv (12,499 concepts: DEV 4,771, held-out PHYS/LIFEENV/SOC/MATHDEC 742/1,113/1,352/165, cohort 4,356), episodes.csv (27,393 concept x off-home-field episodes with R and the R_abs1-3 sensitivity outcomes for all splits), concept_outcomes.csv (O1, O3, O2r_m30/m50) and concept_features_basic.csv (G, G_A, G_btw, REL_home, RS, DOM_*, count/label indicators, B5).

  The spec was frozen on DEV (sha256 in logs/seal.log) and unsealed once. H1: held-out dAUC -0.00001 [-0.0006, +0.0003] (DEV +0.00001), DL pooled -0.00004 (I2 = 0), cohort -0.0001. The placebo was not exceeded and the conditional logit is null. Verdict: DISCONFIRMED. Power: the minimum detectable dAUC is 0.004. The relatedness pair beats gateway on held-out (+0.0034 [0.0010, 0.0051] vs 0). The baseline ladder shows gateway's DEV signal (+0.0019 over the iteration-1 base) vanishes once P_j(-c) is added, and reverses on held-out (-0.0016). Gateway alone has AUC 0.605 on DEV vs 0.506 on held-out (0.41 in SOC): gateway is a domain-specific proxy for 'fields that keep things'. Iteration-1 replication: +0.023 (vs +0.10). H3: held-out partial rho G 0.030 / G_A 0.026 / G_btw 0.046 (Holm p = 0.0045); within-group DL pooled G 0.068 [0.029, 0.107]. The effect is small; the tests show 0/40 false positives on shuffled outcomes. REL_home is strongly negative (-0.14).

  An independent audit (sklearn, own AUC) matches to 1e-6. Deviations: no OpenAlex API audit or insularity (credits exhausted); LLM cap raised to $3.50; T3 t0 agreement 53%. See README.md, results/*.json and figures/.

title: Where new scientific concepts spread next
summary: >-
  Full-corpus OpenAlex snapshot experiment (476M works, 0 API credits for data) on how 653 newborn concepts (legacy-concept
  lexicon, tag-AND-title grounding; benchmark precision 0.996, LLM+hand labelled, $0.007) enter new venue fields, using the
  frozen iteration-1 26-field PMI backbone. Dev = CS/Eng/BGM/Med homes, t0 2003-09 (274 concepts); held-out = other fields
  + 2010-14 cohort (369), run ONCE after a hashed freeze. H2 ENTRY (conditional logit on concept-year risk sets): relatedness
  to the off-home fields that currently RETAIN the concept predicts the next field entered beyond size, Hidalgo density, relatedness-to-home
  and own centrality: held-out LR 71.7 (p=2e-17), d=0.30 [0.24,0.37], positive in Physical/LifeEnv/Social/Cohort, DL pooled
  0.28 [0.22,0.35] I2=0, label-permutation p=0.001, rewired-backbone p=0.015 -> CONFIRMED by the frozen rule. BUT the gateway
  WEIGHTING adds nothing beyond plain retaining relatedness (M3 vs M1 g-only permutation p=0.17 held-out, 0.31 dev); target-field
  size is the strongest single block (AUC 0.76 vs density 0.59); incremental AUC only 0.809->0.817. ORDERING: first retained
  gateway field precedes the calibrated entropy take-off in 66% of broad concepts (sign p=0.003) vs 57% for peripheral fields
  (McNemar p=0.09) -> confirmed by rule, but the lead-lag gateway-permutation placebo (p=0.63) says the panel does not single
  out gateway fields. RESCUE (background-adjusted citation provenance, shared-author links removed; Hanski connectivity) and
  RELAY (availability-null) NOT supported on held-out; the iteration-1 gateway-retention lead did NOT replicate (coef ~0).
  TRAJECTORIES: DTW k-medoids k=2 stable (bootstrap ARI 1.0): volume-matched 'integrating' vs 'localized' classes (held-out
  independent recluster ARI 0.54; localized class dominated by Medicine homes). Independent audits: R1, p_gw and held-out
  AUCs reproduced exactly; exact-likelihood clogit gives LR 77.3, DL-pooled d 0.32 [0.25,0.39] (Breslow pipeline is conservative);
  within-stratum shuffled labels reject 0/20; random-year ordering placebo 0.43 << 0.66. Outputs: method_out.json (entry_events_dev/heldout
  with predict_M0 vs predict_M2 within-stratum probabilities; retention_episodes), results/*.json|csv (frame_concepts, episodes,
  dev/heldout results, frozen_spec, grounding report, deviations), figures/ (AUC forest, group forest, incidence curve, trajectory
  clusters, event studies, case field-flow plots). Caveats: 1,865 episodes (<4k target), MathDec untestable, sense filter
  uninformative, no Wikidata aliases.

title: Does the gateway-field retention signal replicate?
summary: >-
  Zero-API stress test of iteration-1's only live lead: the adopting field's gateway (eigenvector) centrality on the 1998-2002
  26-field PMI backbone (gateway_j) adding +0.103 AUC for field retention R (exp4, 80 episodes). Pre-registered verdict: FAILS.
  Reproduction: exp4's 0.10254 / 0.10222 reproduce exactly. Block A (LOGO logistic, concept-clustered REFIT bootstrap): delta-AUC
  over M2 (own field baseline + B5 + log field size + phi_home + density) is exp4 +0.037 [95% CI -0.018, 0.130], exp1 (s2-fos
  crosswalk, 367 rows) +0.001, exp3 (129) -0.006, union panel (362 de-duplicated episodes, 54 concepts) +0.001 [-0.012, 0.012],
  new-episodes-only panel (282) -0.001 [-0.021, 0.017]; the DL pooled value is +0.0015 (I2=0, descriptive). exp4's own M0
  lead keeps a refit CI of [0.010, 0.212], but the multi-feature iteration-1 rows lose significance. B1: gateway adds +0.0015
  over M2 + leave-concept-out field propensity P (union). B2: gateway explains 50% of exp4 field intercepts (p=0.14, 10 fields)
  and removes 74% of the field variance there, but R2=0.03 (p=0.55) and 2.5% on the union panel. B3: the time-varying backbone
  validates (rho 0.92) but is NOT IDENTIFIABLE (within/between SD 0.023). C2 node-label permutation: the union real value
  is at the 54th percentile; C1 rewiring discriminates (median rho 0.32): exp4 M0 at p=0.01, union not significant; no rival
  centrality (strength, degree, betweenness, PageRank, closeness, k-core, phi_min eigenvector, size) survives Holm correction.
  D: all 8 G-variant O1 gains (+0.05..+0.15) are label-coverage ARTEFACTS (G +0.072 -> +0.002). E: concept ICC 0.135; with
  a field random intercept the SD of delta-AUC under the alternative stays at ~0.015 whatever N is (1k-4k), an MDE floor of
  ~0.02 from having only 26 fields; ~34 held-out concepts per group give P(group delta>0)>=0.9 at a true delta of 0.05. F:
  corrected record tables (rho_B5, A*_h, exp3 portability, exp4 secondary screens, F5 refit CIs). Reusable output: results/union_episodes.csv
  (harmonised union panel). An independent audit (own solver) re-derives the headline deltas; a shuffled-R placebo on exp4's
  80 rows gives a 95th percentile of 0.130, above 0.103, so the original lead cannot be certified on 80 episodes. All tables
  are in eval_out.json metadata; the flat headline numbers are in metrics_agg.

title: When research concepts were officially recognised
summary: |-
  External-recognition lookup table (outcome O5) for all 65,026 OpenAlex legacy concepts (64,723 target concepts at levels 2-5), built with zero OpenAlex credits and $1.49 of OpenRouter calls. Every event is dated and sourced, and carries year_usable, match_method, match_confidence and relation (same/narrower/broader, stated from the external entry's side). Present-day facts sit in a separate present_day block (year_known=false). sources_checked records found / not_found / not_applicable for each concept and source. There are no O5 flags and no t0 lags; the panel builder derives those.

  Sources: MeSH 2026 (20,872 concepts; DateIntroduced year; mesh_baseline flags years <=1966); English Wikipedia creation dates (6,540 exact first revisions with redirect-first repair; all other titles have a page-id estimate, 93% same calendar year in CV, and year_usable only for years that calibrate well); Wikidata P571/P575 (1,425 concepts); ACM CCS 1998/2012, MSC 2000/2010/2020 and PACS 2010/PhySH (taxonomy_in_version and taxonomy_added_between events); Nature Methods MoTY, Science BOTY, Physics World BOTY 2009-2025, MIT TR10, Gartner Hype Cycle 1995-2025 and Clarivate/CAS Research Fronts 2017-2025 (589 concepts); JEL as present-day membership only.

  Datasets (full_data_out/ parts): concept_recognition (65,026), external_entries_{mesh 31,830, acm_ccs 3,583, msc 17,872, pacs_physh 8,462, jel 1,015, curated_lists 2,666}, match_verifications (28,914 LLM judgements), crosswalk_level1_to_field (284) and spotcheck_p78 (78; 86% of the iteration-1 P78 concepts join). metadata_fold is a provisional dev/heldout/unassigned split from level-1 ancestors mapped to the OpenAlex fields and then to the hypothesis groups. It holds 19.6k/28.3k/17.1k concepts, and plurality group and share are included so the panel can apply S1's rule.

  Quality: all known-answer asserts pass (optogenetics NM 2010, iPSC NM 2009, CRISPR BOTY 2015, super-resolution NM 2008). Audit precision is 0.96 for label matches, 0.79 for ID links and 0.31 for alias-only matches, so alias matches were LLM-verified. Accepted LLM links are 0.97 precise on hand check. relation=same is reliable except for Research Fronts; narrower vs broader is only indicative. Inter-model kappa is 0.60 (accept/reject). Caveats: coverage is uneven (Social and Eng have no dated domain taxonomy, so use a Wikipedia/Wikidata-only O5 variant across groups), Wikipedia dates cluster in its 2001-2007 growth wave, and Research Fronts are citation-derived. See README.md, out/coverage_report.json and out/sources.json.

title: How our results compare with related papers
summary: |-
  Positioning study for the Applied Network Science (ANS) paper on emerging concepts. Deliverables: research_report.md (sections A-F) and raw evidence in raw/.
  (1) Collection: 'Networks for everyday life' cannot be read by any route (Springer IdP/JS, no Wayback snapshot). Only the scope text was recovered (societal domains: health, mobility, education, politics; rolling). The member list, editors and deadline are unknown, so do not claim topic overlap; argue fit through foresight/funding relevance and ANS method overlap.
  (2) 22 citable ANS papers with a 'how we relate' line each. The core set: Fontaine 2024 (AI into neuroscience), De Domenico 2016 (disciplines as sources/sinks), Holmgren 2023 (alluvial change), Gao 2018, Cunningham 2022, Larson 2017, Renoust 2017 (ANS 2:23). Plus about 40 neighbour-journal and preprint works.
  (3) Comparison numbers:
  - Guevara 2016 field-entry AUC: individuals 0.896, organisations 0.715, countries 0.682. Entry only, no exit. Our density AUC 0.61 < log-size 0.74: report density's increment over size.
  - Exit and survival evidence (Neffke 2011, Rigby 2015, Goya 2019) is regression-based and credits relatedness. No published retention AUC exists, so our +0.10 delta-AUC (0.705 -> 0.808, base rate 0.56) is an increment without a direct counterpart.
  - Link-forecast AUCs of 0.95-0.97 (Maillart 2606.03864; Gu & Krenn >0.9; Krenn positives about 1-3%) are level AUCs and not comparable.
  - Maillart 2606.03919 R2 0.60-0.87 are within-domain replications, not cross-field transfer.
  - Weng 2013: about 7x the precision of random guessing from the first 50 tweets (H3 precedent).
  (4) Novelty: adopter-centrality retention is NEW for concept adoption by fields but partially anticipated in general (Hidalgo 2007 position -> faster diversification; Yenilmez 2026 centrality explains diversification). The rescue/metapopulation analogy is partially anticipated in cultural evolution (Premo & Kuhn 2010; Premo 2012; Hopkinson 2011). Relay is partially anticipated (Weng 2013; Cheng 2023; Leydesdorff betweenness). Frame H1 as the first test in science, not a new principle. RISK: reviewers will want the adopter-portfolio relatedness-density rival.
  (5) ANS template, inferred from 8 articles from 2024-2026: unstructured abstract of 165-297 words; keywords optional; Introduction/Methods/Results/Discussion/Conclusions; back matter; author-year citations; 1-12 figures. Model wording for data availability and competing interests is included.
  (6) About 95 references verified; 12 corrections (Centola/Weng for complex contagion; Hidalgo/Neffke/Guevara for relatedness; Maillart authorship; Cunningham & Greene in PLoS ONE; wrong DOIs for Pinheiro, Yan, Kiss and Bettencourt fixed).

title: Do concepts spread from fields that keep them?
summary: |-
  Decisive zero-credit test of the retained-frontier claim (EXP6 lead: a concept next enters fields related to the off-home fields that currently RETAIN it, d0_ret_rel) against the field-standard relatedness-density rival built as the literature builds it (omega = sum U phi / sum phi with U = RCA>1: annual Hidalgo current portfolio [primary], 3-year, Guevara-2016 cumulative and persistence-filtered), plus share-weighted density (D_vol, D_vol_w3, D_cum), and of the abandonment penalty (d_lost: relatedness to dropped off-home presences). Conditional logit (Breslow) on concept x target-field x year entry risk sets, concept-year strata, frozen 1998-2002 26-field PMI backbone; nested ladder R0 (home relatedness, log size, entered density, own gateway) -> R1 +D_rca_1y -> R2 +D_vol -> R3 +d0 -> R4 +d_lost; S_strict = all 4 RCA + both D_vol; S_pca; A1 = R0 + d_lost.

  STEP 1 (EXP6 frame, robustness): risk sets rebuilt row-for-row (max diff 4e-16) and EXP6 held-out M1 vs M0 LR 68.57 / d0 0.2809 reproduced; d0 survives RCA>1 and volume: R3 0.262 [0.196,0.320], S_strict 0.252 [0.188,0.315], permutation p=0.001.

  STEP 2 (independent frame: EXP5 12,499 concepts minus every EXP6 concept by OpenAlex ID/QID/normalised label -> 11,841; DEV 4,486 used for code, standardisation, power and rules; hash-frozen, git 24da538; held-out scored ONCE). Held-out pooled PHYS+LIFEENV+SOC+MATHDEC (3,162 concepts, 6,978 entries): LR(R3 vs R2)=325.8, d0=0.322 [0.291,0.355] (concept refit bootstrap 1,000), S_strict 0.304 [0.268,0.336], crossed concept x field CI [0.201,0.468]; positive in PHYS 0.15, LIFEENV 0.40, SOC 0.30 (MATHDEC 0.07, underpowered, excluded pre-freeze), cohort 2010-14 0.321 [0.292,0.347]; DL 4 groups 0.243 [0.118,0.368], I2=0.92. Retained-label permutation p=0.001, rewire p=0.004, node-label p=0.003; dose by persistence age 2/3/>=4 = 0.10/0.08/0.30 (4+ minus 2: 0.21 [0.16,0.26]); stable under target-field FE (0.30), RCA-defined entry event (0.24), primary-topic fields, min_n 3/5, horizon 8, exclusions. BUT the pre-declared volume-matched contrast (retained vs entered-not-retained fields in the same current x cumulative volume cell) is null: -0.028 [-0.105,0.046] (fine bins -0.026), so frozen verdict FRONTIER = PARTIAL ('persistence confounded with volume'). Also: under a Hidalgo min-conditional-probability proximity d0 vanishes (-0.021, p=0.012) - backbone-specific; the econ-geo LPM row gives d0 slightly negative, and an EXPLORATORY diagnostic shows it is ~0 once size enters non-linearly (relative-odds, not additive-probability, effect). ABANDONMENT: d_lost in A1 = -0.007 [-0.036,0.022] (power 0.99 at -0.06) -> INCONCLUSIVE/no penalty; with d0 it turns positive (+0.064). Within-stratum AUC R2 0.847 -> R3 0.852; Guevara-comparable global AUC of D_rca_cum 0.635 (flagged, different unit/event).

  Checks: 10 unit tests pass; planted d0=0.2 detected 100%, null rejection 0/200; shuffled entries 0/20; independent audit (hand Breslow exact reproduction; statsmodels EXACT likelihood LR ratio 0.99-1.02; 20 rows re-derived from raw counts; inline DL) all pass. Outputs: results/frontier_result.json (all numbers), step1/step2 JSONs, frozen_spec + seal/unseal logs, risk-set and state-panel parquets, null draws, 6 figures (forest d0 / d_lost by unit, ladder, dose, null histograms, volume-matched), method_out.json = full_method_out.json (252,922 held-out candidate rows with predict_R2_rca_vol_baseline vs predict_R3_retained_frontier from frozen DEV coefficients). No LLM or OpenAlex spend.

title: Auditing the record before the paper
summary: >-
  Zero-new-data audit of the iteration-2 record (eval_out.json, exp_eval_sol_out, validated). WP1 claims_ledger.csv: 246 rows
  read by key path (224 MATCH, 15 MISLABELLED, 6 MISMATCH, 1 FILE_FLAG_OVERRIDDEN; 58 blocking). H1: lpm_beta_within_gt0_p05
  = true (beta +0.068/SD, concept-clustered p 0.041, two-way p 0.17; sealed code uses p_concept), verdict still DISCONFIRMED.
  Ordering -> MIXED: 57/87 non-tied = 65.5%, but 57/102 evaluable and 57/175 = 32.6% of broad concepts; lead-lag negative,
  pre-trend ev-3 -0.072 (p 0.0002), DEV reverse b 0.232 (p 0.006). H3: pooled CI [-0.006, 0.065] includes 0; DEV 0.138 ->
  shrinkage 0.21; 0/40 is a false-positive rate. Dataset-2 counts 3,583/17,872/8,462/1,015 are ENTRIES (concepts 1,298/1,121/2,635/213).
  The 'B5+all_four' row is size_controlled_all_three (+0.085, refit CI [-0.043, 0.220]). MDE 0.004 is the 90% point for 8,515
  episodes. WP2: record_tables/ has the 34-indicator portability table, exp1 lineage robustness, 12 partial associations,
  H1 criteria, ordering, coverage_iter2 and refit bootstrap CIs (B=2000; all 7 iteration-1 deltas reproduce exactly; none
  of the CIs excludes 0; 1.2-2.2x wider than fixed CIs). T4 next_field_trace.json reproduces all 26 Exp6 headline numbers:
  LR 68.6 = M1 vs M0 Breslow, 71.7 = M2 vs M0 Breslow, 77.3 = M2 exact (M1 exact 73.2); 961 = informative strata, 2,339 =
  all primary strata; d 0.281 = M1, 0.302 = M2. The per-row parquet is in record_tables/. WP3 frame_agreement.json (628 shared
  concepts): onset exact 0.976, home kappa 0.99, O2r_m50 rho 0.998, episode Jaccard median 1.0, but retention kappa 0.28 (0.98
  with the matched absolute R_abs2 rule) -> pooling PARTIAL. An Exp5-minus-Exp6 H2 confirmation must rebuild RETAINED/LOST
  with R_cj. Concepts left: PHYS 708, LIFEENV 1,081, SOC 1,301, MATHDEC 165, COHORT 4,117. WP4 o5_validation.json: O5_main
  held-out base rate 0.238, UNRELATED to publication outcomes (pooled rho O2r_m50 0.014 [-0.045, 0.073], O1 0.001). 67% of
  concepts are recognised at or before t0. Executor-checked 100-item hand check: precision 0.86, dates within 1 year 95%,
  false-negative rate >= 0.14, FIT_FOR_USE true, but only 42% of positives mark a genuinely new concept. LLM spend $0.009.
  text_corrections.md gives the old and new sentences with source keys. verify_headlines.py re-derives the headline numbers
  independently, with placebos.

title: Is 'fields that keep it' new? Prior art and venue check
summary: |-
  Prior-art, comparison and venue positioning for the iteration-3 ANS paper. It builds on art_dxvRpQufMR0e.

  (1) CLAIM A (next-field entry follows relatedness to fields that RETAIN a concept): PARTIALLY ANTICIPATED.
  - Persistence is used only as a filter on the entry OUTCOME: Pinheiro et al. 2022 (Δ=4 backward/forward RCA rule), Albora et al. 2023 (RCA<0.25 in all prior years), Bahar et al. 2014 (jumps).
  - All densities found are current-snapshot (RCA>1 or continuous).
  - No retained-only or duration-weighted density predictor was found in 6 strands.
  - Cheng et al. 2023 ("consistent intellectual usage" → core concept) is the closest science analogue; it is global, not per field.

  (2) CLAIM B (relatedness to fields that DROPPED it lowers entry): mechanism partly anticipated; NEW as a test.
  - Mechanism precedents: Fernandes & Tang 2014 (negative neighbour signals deter entry; empirically, neighbours' export growth); Nomaler & Verspagen 2022 (absence/loss informative, adds little).
  - No study uses neighbours' exits as entry predictors.
  - Our Exp6 estimate is fragile: d_lost −0.063, p 0.055.

  (3) RIVALS FOR THE EXPERIMENT
  - MISSING: persistence-filtered RCA density D_rca_persist_k; own pre-entry RCA level/trend (Albora benchmark); neighbour-momentum density.
  - PARTLY COVERED: a β_ret = β_lost test within D_ever.

  (4) RQ1 TABLE R1
  - No comparator uses held-out fields.
  - Link-forecast AUCs (Krenn 0.85 with ~5% positives; 0.95-0.97) are level metrics and not comparable to our increments over B5.

  (5) RQ2 TABLE R2
  - Prior work has field-pair modes (Sun & Latora, 4) and source/sink indices.
  - No contact × retention decomposition and no per-field entered/retained/lost tracking was found: NEW.
  - Entity-entry AUROC comparators: 0.879/0.856/0.631 (Galuppo Azevedo 2021).

  (6) VENUE
  - The collection page is IdP-blocked by every route.
  - Snippets give: submissions open 24 Jun 2026, deadline 30 Nov 2026, scope items on information diffusion and innovation/collaboration/knowledge-exchange networks.
  - Editors and member articles are unrecovered.

  (7) ANS SKELETON AND FIG. 1
  - Skeleton from 3 sci-sci ANS articles (Cunningham 2022 published; Fontaine 2024 and Holmgren 2023 on arXiv), plus a 5-lane Fig. 1 spec with this run's counts and a caption draft.

  (8) REFERENCES AND FILES
  - 50 new references verified (references_new.json); 4 UNVERIFIED items flagged.
  - Files: research_report.md (sections A-H) and reproducibility.md.

title: Do open-neighbourhood concepts spread? Fresh-cohort test
summary: >-
  Single-unseal confirmation of the RQ1 openness claim from EXP8, on a fresh 2015-2017 onset cohort of OpenAlex legacy concepts
  that no earlier screen had touched. One zero-credit S3 pass covered the snapshot of 2026-09-23 (identical to EXP5; checks
  T1-T3 exact). The outcome-blind S3 audit kept TAG grounding: legacy tags still cover 2021-24, with the control ratio at
  a minimum of 0.902. The LLM precision gate passed 94% of candidates, leaving 1,070 concepts with 2015-16 onsets. Pre-seal
  power was 0.16, so the declared 2017 extension applied (n = 1,443; 634 with O2r_m50; 573 with OPEN_home). OPEN is the mean
  of six signed, z-scored ego-network components, with constants frozen on the 12,499 EXP5 concepts; it was built ALL / HOME-ONLY
  / SIZE-MATCHED. The ladder runs R0 = B5 + onset year, then adds contact reach, LLM concept type, pre-onset footprint, coverage
  and group FE. The spec was hash-sealed before the unseal. RESULT: the frozen verdict is CONFIRMED but marginal. OPEN_home
  partial Spearman with O2r_m50 is +0.091 [+0.013, +0.171] at R2 and +0.080 [+0.001, +0.162] at R3. The CIs include 0 at R4/R5,
  the DL pool over groups is +0.083 [-0.007, +0.173], and Holm p = 0.048. It adds no practical prediction (B5 Spearman 0.768
  vs 0.770). Mechanical coupling is large: OPEN_all +0.174, ALL minus HOME +0.093 [+0.016, +0.169], with size-matched in between.
  Home-only signal comes from NOV_res (+0.134) and low edge persistence (-0.112), not from the community count. Type and footprint
  do not absorb OPEN. Replications: CONTACT_REACH (+0.211), n_authors_early on O1c (+0.115), RETENTION_RATIO_early < 0 at
  R0 only; the EXP8 ElasticNet beats B5 by +0.030. The type gate failed twice, so the declared M1 = M2 fallback was used.
  O4 was not run. Independent re-derivations (audit.py, rederive.py) reproduce psp exactly; the shuffled and random-OPEN placebos
  are null. LLM spend $2.04. Deliverables: results/cohort_report.json, cohort_result.json, exp5_selection_result.json, figures/,
  full_method_out.json (predict_B5 vs predict_B5_plus_OPEN_home per concept).

title: 'How concepts spread: early reach vs keeping fields'
summary: >-
  Cache-only re-run of the RQ2 trajectories analysis on all 12,499 EXP5 frame concepts (DEV 4,771 CS/Eng/BGM/Med; held-out
  PHYS/LIFEENV/SOC/MATHDEC 3,372; 2010-14 cohort 4,356). Held-out outcomes were previously unsealed by EXP5/EXP7/EXP8, so
  held-out results are within-frame robustness checks; this artifact's choices were hash-sealed on DEV (results/frozen_spec.json)
  before it read held-out data. (1) Exact decomposition of the top-vs-bottom O2r_resid tercile gap in retained off-home breadth
  at t0+8: log Bn = log E2 (early contact, fields entered by t0+2) + log M (frontier advance) + log rho (retention), volume-stratified.
  PR1 SUPPORTED everywhere: s_explore - s_ret (Medicine excluded) DEV 0.633 [0.537,0.727], held-out pooled 0.492 [0.403,0.575],
  cohort 0.445 [0.358,0.527], DL 0.504 [0.329,0.679] (I2 0.76). Shares DEV 0.79/0.03/0.18 (E2/M/rho). Frontier advance M ~0;
  D_rho positive (integrating concepts keep a larger share). Robust to min_n 3/5, O2r_m50, O1b-only, onset-restricted counts,
  Das Gupta and concept-level covariance decompositions. (2) PR2 (localised keep more early) FAILS raw (DEV reversed -0.110,
  held-out null +0.011, cohort reversed); only the partial clause holds (partial Spearman of early retention ratio with O2r_resid
  given B5: -0.169/-0.129/-0.173; replicates EXP8). (3) No trajectory typology passes the naming rule (DTW k=4 vs HMM S=5
  ARI 0.222; Hennig Jaccard 0.69-0.82; no-Med ARI 0.46; held-out re-cluster ARI 0.44/0.38) -> CONTINUUM: PC1 38.8% breadth-of-spread
  axis, PC2 10.7% keep-vs-lose axis. (4) Early ego-network openness (OPEN; 3 builds ALL/HOME-ONLY/SIZE-MATCHED) correlates
  with PC1 beyond B5+label coverage: DEV partial 0.174/0.117/0.135, held-out DL 0.120/0.060/0.094 (I2 0), not with the keeping
  axis. (5) Sequence test: no ordering signal beyond the mechanical lag (excess <=1.7pp, sign flips); intersection-born concepts
  take off off-home later (HR ~0.45). (6) 7 most-similar case pairs (7/7 high-OPEN broader, illustration) and a 37-concept
  retrospective AI/CS atlas. Verification: D3 states equal EXP7 on 5.56M cells; ego code reproduces EXP8 exactly; T0 unit
  tests pass; independent re-derivation of all headline numbers <=1e-16; placebos fail. Files: method_out.json (dataset rq2_concepts

title: Is 'keep exploring, spread widest' already known?
summary: |-
  Novelty and positioning report (iteration 4) for the Exp8 openness-vs-consolidation claim, for the Applied Network Science paper. It builds on art_EesdB8cuSfcU and art_dxvRpQufMR0e without redoing their work. Files: research_report.md (Sections A-I), reproducibility.md, raw/ (query log, fetched page extracts, verify.json).

  VERDICTS
  - C1, openness → later cross-field breadth: PARTIALLY ANTICIPATED. The same direction is shown for concept pairs (Maillart 2026: test R² 0.69 entropy / 0.78 exogenous, random 80/20 split), papers (Wang 2017: odds of top-1% citation in foreign fields +62.37%), memes (Weng 2013) and people (Ugander 2012). Concept-level evidence exists only for volume (Cheng 2023) or transfer to patents (Cao 2020). No study found combines the concept unit, a size-adjusted breadth outcome and held-out fields.
  - C2, consolidation → less breadth: PARTIALLY ANTICIPATED in mechanism (Palla 2007 large-group turnover; Ugander; Weng; Burt) and CONTRADICTED-BY on other outcomes:
    - Cheng et al. 2023 ASR, full text read: "ideational consistency" = cosine of neighbour co-usage t−1→t, i.e. weighted edge persistence. +53% next-year articles per SD (b = .43); embeddedness +25%; author co-author density −15%. The DV is volume at t+1, with no current-volume control and in-sample. The authors state they do not study cross-domain translation.
    - Chavalarias & Cointet 2013: dense term-clusters survive; density rises during emergence and falls before decline.
    - Centola 2010 and Romero 2011: clustering helps adoption.
    - Salatino 2017: density among parent topics precedes birth.
    Recommended framing: an outcome-dependent reversal (consistency → depth/survival, churn → reach).
  - C3, a low retention ratio of contacted fields: NEW (analogues only: propagule/colonisation pressure; Palla; Cheng's social consistency b = .02).
  - C4, within-concept closure → entry slowdown: NEW as a lead-lag test. The field-level prior is opposite (Chavalarias). Life-cycle analogues: Singh 2022, Prabhakaran 2016.

  WHAT THE REPORT PROVIDES
  - An our-numbers card (Exp8 held-out psp|B5 with CIs and I²).
  - Strand-by-strand extraction rows for S1-S9.
  - A Cheng operationalisation box with the reconciling sentence.
  - T-RQ1: ours vs Maillart, Cheng, Cao, Wang, Weng, Ugander, Salatino, Chen, Kong. Level AUCs (Krenn 0.85; 0.954-0.967) are marked not comparable.
  - T-RQ2: 12 trajectory/sequence comparators; our contact × retention decomposition and FE event study have no counterpart.
  - 8 ANS papers with relation lines.
  - An 8-lane Fig. 1 spec with {pipeline_counts.json:KEY} slots and a caption.
  - A 14-row reviewer-threat table.
  - 68 newly verified references, 66/67 identifiers resolved via Crossref/arXiv, plus 12 carried.

  CORRECTIONS AND DESIGN GAPS
  - Corrected DOIs: Chen 2012 = 10.1002/asi.21694 (not asi.22662); Moser & Nicholas = 10.1257/0002828041301407; Feldman & Yoon = 10.1093/icc/dtr040.

  - DESIGN GAPS for the experiments:
    1. ego_density_W3 is not degree-normalised (Ravasz & Barabási C(k) ~ 1/k); add a configuration-null z-score.
    2. Run Cheng's exact consistency/embeddedness measures on volume vs breadth; the predicted result is a sign flip.
    3. Report survival alongside breadth and test the size × turnover interaction (Palla).
    4. Concept-type tagging with within-type tests; no prior effect size exists.
    5. Heterogeneity-robust staggered event-study estimators for C4.

title: Does the churn signal hold for brand-new phrases?
summary: >-
  A sealed, single-unseal confirmation of the home-neighbourhood openness / novelty signal (EXP8 -> EXP10) on a second, vocabulary-free
  population, Frame N: newborn title noun phrases (onsets 2003-2015) that are absent from the 56,643 legacy OpenAlex/MAG concepts
  and the 65,026 art_O7Dq4L02QnDN labels. It used zero OpenAlex credits: two passes over the 2026-09-23 S3 snapshot. Pass
  M took a 20% file sample and yielded 407k n-gram keys, 132,077 candidates at k_t=4 after exclusions and POS. Pass N covered
  all 2,040 files, 1995-2022, with 24.2M verified hits; outcome rows were sealed at write time. Base totals equal EXP10 exactly.
  The masked onset rule gave 4,468 onsets. After dedup and home, 2,257 phrases went to the LLM gates; M1 kept 1,137 and the
  categorical G2 gate kept 636 concepts. Declared deviations: one outcome-blind re-mine (v1 bursts, recall 6% < 15%) and G2,
  adopted after the boolean gate failed the blind checks (keep-precision 0.37 and 0.43; G2 0.63 on the dev set). Fallback
  E added the 2015 onsets. Fallback A switched the primary outcome to O2r_m30 (397 < 800 concepts with O2r_m50). Pre-unseal
  power at psp 0.08 was 0.47. FROZEN VERDICT: PARTIAL. OPEN_home psp is +0.117 [+0.020, +0.218] at R3 and +0.086 [-0.009,
  +0.190] at R5. On O2r_m50 it is +0.161 and +0.122, with both CIs > 0. NOVCHURN_home at R3 is +0.108 [+0.007, +0.211]. 3
  of 4 estimable groups are positive (SOC -0.025); DL is +0.112 [-0.015, +0.239]; Holm p is 0.052. NOV_res_home carries the
  signal (+0.208); edge persistence is null. Coupling (ALL-HOME +0.056) is not significant. Cheng consistency predicts next-year
  volume (rho +0.42, surviving size control) but is -0.064 with breadth (CI includes 0), so the reversal is not confirmed.
  Embeddedness is -0.250 with breadth. The clean variants agree (rarefied NOVCHURN +0.150). There is no forecasting gain over
  B5 (Spearman 0.80). Versus legacy newborns, Frame-N concepts are 14% narrower, 89% more transient and 26% less sustained.
  Exploratory results: the strict-gate subset gives R5 +0.106 [+0.004, +0.217], and pooling with EXP10 gives R3 +0.096 [+0.034,
  +0.158]. The audit reproduces the headline numbers to within 1e-9. LLM spend: $0.92.

  verdict: REVERSAL CONFIRMED (on selection data), REVERSAL REPLICATED, SIZE-DOMINATED, DEPTH-REACH SPLIT (the split is null-depth
  vs negative-reach). TEST C (within concept, ci+year FE): consistent years followed by slightly MORE off-home entries (b=+0.025,
  boot CI [0.004,0.048]) -> P6 fails; reach penalty is a between-concept trait. TEST D: no Palla size x consistency interaction.
  TEST E: ALL-papers build more negative for reach (diff -0.032). Identity: Spearman 0.77 with Exp11 Jaccard persistence,
  0.34 with log early volume. Adding CONS to a DEV-fitted B5 rank model does not improve held-out prediction (delta ~0). All
  bodies are selection data (outcomes previously read), not confirmation. Independent re-derivation (rederive.py: statsmodels
  GLM full panel, QR psp from raw inputs) matches all headline numbers except C1 (not re-derived); placebos fail. Key files:

title: Why churning concepts spread; Exp11 test completed
summary: >-
  Cache-only, $0-LLM iteration-5 experiment with three parts. (C) Completion of the sealed Exp11 within-concept closure test
  from its sealed code, with a path-only patch and single BLAS threads (the fix for the Exp11 crash). Gates pass: G0 21/21
  sealed hashes, the rebuilt panel equals the cache, G1 DEV reproduces exactly, and all 8 Exp11 unit tests pass. DEV verdict
  unchanged: NOT SUPPORTED. OLD_HELDOUT PPML: density +0.068 [-0.072,+0.209]; OPEN_home -0.079 [-0.146,-0.013], the opposite
  of the predicted sign. COHORT 2010-14: both null. H-M5 fails; H-M3 is null in all bodies. Sun-Abraham event study, DEV never-treated:
  lag 0..2 = -0.018 [-0.042,+0.004], pre-trend p 0.52, Roth detectable slope 0.022, event-date placebo p 0.19; held-out and
  cohort null. H-M4 fails. Home volume itself drops at the closure jump (-0.022, CI<0), so the jumps are partly mechanical.
  H-S1 holds on DEV (+0.113), COHORT (+0.105) and pooled (+0.076 [+0.024,+0.126]) but not on OLD_HELDOUT (+0.001). Pooled
  off-home entries fall after the home-prominence peak (-0.030 [-0.047,-0.016]). H-P1 as preregistered fails: the community
  half is +0.216 [+0.081,+0.351], the METHOD half -0.055. (A, EXPLORATORY, spec hash-sealed before the outcome join) The HOME
  new, dropped and added partner sets are rebuilt with the EXP8 primitives (G2 reproduces Exp10 exactly). Each partner is
  classified by METHOD/DOMAIN type, new/same community, degree under the null and mixed/pure carrier, giving an exact additive
  decomposition of NOV_res, new_edge_rate and churn. Parts are scored by partial Spearman given B5 with 2,000 concept bootstraps
  and DL over held-out groups, plus Shapley games, Holm over 5 contrasts and two label placebos. NOVCHURN_home replicates:
  POOLED +0.118, held-out DL +0.097 (I2 0), 2015-17 cohort +0.171/+0.144 at R0/R3. The signal comes from new-community partners
  (C2 +0.102, Holm p .0025; cohort +0.18) that arrive through mixed-field papers (C4 +0.103; the mixed player's Shapley value
  exceeds the whole psp) and from turnover of hub partners. DOMAIN-old partners are negative. It is concept-level composition,
  not partner identity: a within-concept shuffle reproduces the low-degree contrast. The METHOD excess (P-A1) is DEV-only
  and not replicated in the cohort; P-A5 (drop vs add) fails. Bridging papers (5% of early home papers: more first-time authors,
  more off-home topics) halve NOVCHURN's psp (0.118 -> 0.056). CV ridge gain over B5 is small (+0.0015 to +0.004 Spearman).
  (B) Hashed trait prediction P-B1 FAILS: yearly OPEN_home ICC is 0.37/0.34/0.39 (REML agrees), NOVCHURN 0.26-0.29, size control
  0.64-0.73. The window retest is 0.51-0.57, the deg>=5 ICC about 0.50 and the disattenuated retest 0.86-0.91, so openness
  is a fair trait measured through a noisy yearly window. Outputs: results/exp11_completion.json, partner_classes.json, partner_shapley.json,
  trait_stability.json, bridging_papers_summary.json, method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out), figures, and README with JSON keys.

  Iteration-5 evaluation 4 (plan gen_plan_evaluation_1). Zero new data, $0 LLM, no OpenAlex credit. GATES: G0 48 inputs present
  (sha256 in results/inputs_manifest.json). G1 reproduces Exp10's EXP5 OPEN_home psp exactly (R0 +0.099, R2 +0.076; HOME NOV_res

title: Is research-topic churn real or small-sample noise?
summary: >-
  Cache-only ($0 LLM) confound check of the home-only churn/novelty signal on 13,444 selection concepts (DEV 4670, OLDHO 3214,
  COH1014 4195, COH1517 1365; n_home_early>=10). Gate T0 reproduces EXP10 exactly (diff 0; cohort OPEN_home +0.0906, NOV_res
  +0.1337, edge_persistence -0.1123). A validated vectorised engine (lib/fast6.py == ego.concept_core to 1e-16) computes raw
  indicators and noise-controlled variants: V1 fixed-n rarefaction (n=5/10/20, 50 draws), V2 within-concept year-permutation
  null (200) + Chao-2005 Jaccard, V3 configuration nulls (200 igraph backbone rewires for density, k-matched set null, numba
  curveball for persistence), V4 split-half reliability; composites NOVCHURN_* and OPEN_home_clean/exc with constants sealed
  before outcome join. Findings (partial Spearman with O2r_m50 | B5+R2, B=2000, results/clean_vs_raw_psp.json): mechanical
  verdict PARTLY_THIN. Pooled NOVCHURN_raw +0.116 [0.09,0.14]; V2 excess NOVCHURN_exc +0.008 (retention 0.06; P1 fails: 0.40
  COH1517, 0.05 OLDHO); fixed-n NOVCHURN_rare10 +0.078 (retention 0.68; 0.76 COH1517, 0.64 OLDHO); Chao/curveball composites
  keep 91-100%. Raw persistence is 66% explained by its own V2 null mean (thin-sample share), rho with log n +0.72, and the
  V2 null mean predicts the outcome (-0.120) at least as strongly as raw persistence (-0.088): the signal is a static topical-dispersion
  property of the home topic mix, not temporal partner turnover. V2 excess variants have split-half SB ~0.01-0.05 and PC2
  (planted churn) fails, so V2 cannot adjudicate temporal churn at ~10 papers/year. Degree normalisation helps: z_dens_cfg
  -0.091 (raw density null), OPEN_home_clean +0.115 vs OPEN_home +0.092 same sample (diff +0.022 [0.011,0.034]); P2 z_pers_cfg
  -0.116 holds; P3 holds. Reliability SB: NOVCHURN_raw 0.48, OPEN_home 0.49, OPEN_home_clean 0.58, outcome O2r_m50 0.895;
  disattenuated pooled NOVCHURN_raw 0.178 (approx). Frame-N joint power (OPEN R3&R5&NOVCHURN R3): 0.07/0.26 at n=800/2500
  with T3, 0.31/0.75 with T2. Reusable outputs: data/clean_variants.parquet (per-concept raw+clean variants, no outcomes),
  results/reliability.json, size_dependence.json, power_frame_n.json, frozen_spec.json + frozen_constants_S1b.json (hash-sealed),
  method_out.json (7,748 examples; DEV-fitted OLS predictions B5 +/- variants). Selection data, outcomes previously unsealed:
  robustness evidence, not confirmation. Independently re-derived (rederive.py, tests/headline_check.py, different code path;
  shuffled-outcome controls null): P1-P3 psp, pooled NOVCHURN_raw/exc/rare10, null-mean persistence, OPEN_home_clean psp,
  SB of NOVCHURN_raw, thin-sample share. Not re-derived: power simulation, DL pooling, disattenuation CIs.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the evidence recorded here actually supports what the run concluded, and whether a direction it abandoned was abandoned for a good reason.

<previous_review>
Your review from the previous iteration. Check which critiques the newest section
addressed. Do NOT re-raise critiques that have been adequately fixed. Only re-raise if the
fix is insufficient.

The previous review is BLOCKING: the paper must not ship as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Fabricated case-study rows (Section 26.4, and 26.4's closing prose). Exp12 art_uw4OeagJP3rv results/case_pairs.json contains exactly 7 pairs: Graphics processing unit/Vertical axis wind turbine, Shotgun proteomics/Image-guided radiation therapy, Nanocarriers/Nanosheet, Soft power/Autonomous learning, Scopus/Oxygen reduction reaction, Sclerostin/IgG4-related disease, User-generated content/Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Only the first two appear in the report. The other five report rows do not exist in any Exp12 output: Systems biology/Tissue engineering, Bayesian optimization/Reservoir computing, Social network analysis/Brain-computer interface, Deep learning/Metamaterial, Synthetic biology/Spintronics. The 'OPEN diff'/'O2r diff' cells are qualitative words, not the numbers on disk. The sentence 'GPU computing and deep learning are canonical cases' describes a concept that is not in the pair set. The artifact also labels these pairs 'illustration, not inference' (7/7 descriptive, no p-value), which the report does not say.
  Action: Delete the invented rows and rebuild 26.4 from case_pairs.json. Give pair id, reporting group, high and low concept, OPEN_all (high/low), OPEN_home, logvol, O2r_resid, Bn, E2 and rho. Add the artifact's caveat that the pairs are an illustration only. Add a '[Correction, iteration 4]' note stating that the previous table contained rows not produced by any artifact. Also mention the 37-concept retrospective AI/CS atlas (ai_atlas/table.csv), the only execution of the request's exploratory AI stage.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) An executed iteration-4 artifact is absent: iter_4/gen_art/gen_art_experiment_11, plan gen_plan_experiment_2 'Does closing up at home slow a concept's spread?'. It hash-sealed a within-concept pre-registration (prereg.md, logs/seal.log) and ran the DEV body models on 35,328 concept-years from 4,661 concepts (results/fe_results.json). H-M1 density PPML b = -0.070 [-0.180, 0.040], p = 0.21. H-M2 OPEN_home b = +0.015 [-0.038, 0.069]. The joint model is null, and so is the LPM twin. DL over groups: density -0.075 [-0.210, 0.061], I2 0.25; OPEN 0.012 [-0.040, 0.065]. H-M3 forward-minus-reverse diff 0.0009 [-0.010, 0.012]. By the frozen rule ('NOT SUPPORTED = both H-M1 and H-M2 CIs include 0 on DEV') this is a null. The Sun-Abraham event study was interrupted (logs/event_study.out KeyboardInterrupt), and there is no .aii_worker_result.json. Meanwhile Section 24 says 'Four artifacts were executed', Section 31 counts 'fifteen commissioned, twelve completed; three failed' (true: 20 commissioned, 16 completed, 4 failed/incomplete), and 28.1 records C4 'within concept closure -> entry slowdown' as NEW. The run's own test of that claim was null and is hidden.
  Action: Add 'Section 25a: Experiment 11 (incomplete)'. Give the plan, the preregistered H-M1 to H-M5, H-S1 and H-P1, the DEV table from fe_results.json (H_M1, H_M2, joint, lpm, H_M3 with bootstrap CIs, by_group, DL_*) and the verdict (NOT SUPPORTED on DEV). State that held-out, cohort and event study were not run because the worker stopped. List it in 29 as a dead end. In 28.1 add that the run's own lead-lag test of C4 was null on DEV. Fix the counts in 24 and 31.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The OPEN conclusions contradict Exp10's own reading. Exp10 README: 'Mechanical coupling is real and large ... EXP8's openness signal was therefore inflated by coupling; the uncoupled remainder is about half as large.' Also: 'Predictive value is negligible ... adding OPEN_home gives 0.770 (+0.002 [-0.003, +0.008]).' Report 25.4 reads ALL-minus-HOME +0.093 as 'confirming that cross field cooccurrence carries information beyond home field structure'. Report 25.7 and 31.1 present OPEN_all and OPEN_sizematch as 'clearly confirmed across all rungs and groups', and say 'the OPEN signal survives controls for ... label coverage and group fixed effects'. That is true only for the coupled builds; OPEN_home's CI includes 0 at R4 and R5. Section 31.1 also cites the Eval3 spec curve (99.7%) as confirmation, but Eval3 states that Part B is EXPLORATORY on already-unsealed groups and that 'OPEN is the all-papers build only'. Other omissions: the pipeline's planted psp = 0.10 was not recovered (+0.047 [-0.045, 0.132]), pre-seal power was 0.16 (MDE 0.105), and n_comm_W3 and participation are null in the HOME build (+0.002, +0.050) although they are headlined in 31.2. Section 25.1 says the cohort is 2015-2016, but it is 2015-2017 (n_by_t0 570/500/373) after the declared power extension.
  Action: Rewrite 25.4 using the artifact's wording: coupling inflates ALL; about half of the ALL-HOME gap is paper count (SIZEMATCH-HOME +0.053 [-0.015, 0.117]). In 25.6, add the OPEN_home predictive row (+0.002 [-0.003, 0.008]). Add the components table, the within-type table, the sensitivity table and the placebo/planted-control paragraph from the Exp10 README. Correct the cohort years. In 31.1, headline only OPEN_home (+0.091, R4/R5 include 0, DL includes 0), label OPEN_all 'mechanically coupled', and label the spec curve 'exploratory, all-papers build'.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Exp12 predictions and results are misstated (Section 26). (a) PR2 in results/preregistration_R2.json is 'LOCALISED KEEP MORE EARLY'. Its raw clause is REVERSED on DEV (-0.110 [-0.132, -0.086]), NOT SUPPORTED held-out (+0.011) and REVERSED in the cohort (-0.058). The report instead invents a 'Prediction 2 (frontier advance is positive): REVERSED'. (b) PR3 is the descriptive sign of D_rho (positive: integrating concepts keep more). The report's 'Prediction 3 (OPEN correlates more with exploration share) ... OPEN correlates with the retention term' contradicts the artifact: OPEN is related to PC1 (breadth) and NOT to PC2 (keeping), with DEV partial -0.07 to -0.11. (c) The report quotes variant i_pooled (0.732 / 0.268, diff 0.464) as the headline without naming it. The preregistered PR1 variant is iv, Medicine excluded: DEV 0.633 [0.537, 0.727], held-out 0.492 [0.403, 0.575], cohort 0.445 [0.358, 0.527], DL 0.504 [0.329, 0.679], I2 0.76. The primary ii volume-stratified variant gives 0.431. (d) The artifact states the shares are 'an accounting identity for the breadth outcome, not causal effects' because Bn and O2r share papers. Section 31.3's 'Breadth is driven by exploration' omits this. (e) Section 26.3 describes a 'lead lag regression of entry on prior retention' that Exp12 did not run. Exp12 ran a home-prominence half-peak vs off-home take-off test against a mechanical-lag null: excess DEV -0.009 [-0.015, -0.003], held-out +0.011 [0.005, 0.016] (rule word HOME-FIRST), cohort -0.017. Intersection-born HR is 0.47 [0.42, 0.54]. This is the request's 'central in home community first, or at intersections?' question, and its numbers are missing.
  Action: Rebuild 26.1 as a table of the four variants (i, ii, iii, iv) × DEV/held-out/cohort from decomposition_*.json, with PR1 on variant iv. Quote PR1, PR1b, PR2 and PR3 verbatim with their verdicts, and add the accounting-identity caveat to 26.1 and 31.3. Replace 26.3 with the sequence_light_*.json table (share A<T, null share, excess [CI], verdict word) and the intersection-born hazard ratios. Add the OPEN~PC1/PC2 table (three builds; DEV, held-out DL, cohort).
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (clarity) Section 27.6 claims 'All corrections have been applied in place', and 27.5 reports '0 MISMATCH', but most of Eval3's insert-ready pack is not in the report. Correction 03 (Exp7) is unapplied: 18.5 still presents d_R_m 0.069 [0.019, 0.118] as the volume-matched result, although the preregistered contrast R-N is -0.008 [-0.071, 0.050] DEV and -0.028 [-0.105, 0.046] held-out. 18.4 is still DEV-only and 'monotone' (held-out 0.098 / 0.075 / 0.304, monotone = False). 18.9 still labels A1 as R4 (R4 d_lost is +0.064). 18.6 still quotes DEV sensitivities, and 18.11 still has the crossed-bootstrap and '7 of 17' slips. 22.1 and 31.4 repeat the DEV 0.069. Correction 07 is unapplied: [ARTIFACT:art_experiment_7], art_experiment_8, art_evaluation_2 and art_research_2 remain in 17-21. From corrections 04/05/06/09/10: 13.1 still gives entry counts as 'Concepts matched' (concepts 1,298/1,121/2,635/213); 5.4 still shows 'B5 + all_four' (size_controlled_all_three, refit CI [-0.043, 0.220]); 4.4 still says 7 partials are 'not available' (record_tables/partial_association_all.csv has 12); 10.7's 0.004 is still misattributed; 20.1 does not list the 6 MISMATCH / 15 MISLABELLED rows; 20.2 still says 67% for every source. Eval3 Step 3 is not recorded either: D_rca_pers differs from D_rca_persist_k (max rho 0.877), so that rival is untested.
  Action: Walk corrections/00_index.md file by file and insert every block at its named section with its tag and Source line. After insertion, rerun verify_ledger.py against the new report text and state the result in 27.5. Replace the 27.6 sentence with a per-file applied/not-applied list.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (clarity) Chronology broken: iteration 3's 'What we have learned so far' (Section 23) was replaced by 'See updated summary at end of iteration 4 (Section 31)'. The iteration-3 conclusions are gone from the record, with no correction marker. They included the iteration-3 claim that the dose response is 'monotone' and the two-class typology listed as confirmed; iter_4/gen_strat/current_report.md lines 1216+ still hold that text. Section 16 (iteration 2) still lists 'Two stable trajectory classes' under Confirmed without an in-place correction, although Exp12 shows ARI 0.20 against its own classes.
  Action: Restore Section 23 verbatim from iter_4/gen_strat/current_report.md. Add '[Correction, iteration 4]' notes where Exp12 and Eval3 overturned it (dose not monotone on held-out; typology CONTINUUM; volume-matched contrast null on DEV too). Add a correction tag under 16.2.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (novelty) Positive claims still lack an honest nearest-neighbour check against this run's own boundaries. Research 3 marks C3 ('low retention ratio -> breadth') NEW, and 31.2 lists RETENTION_RATIO_early as confirmed. But on the fresh cohort it is null once type and reach enter (R2 -0.043 [-0.116, 0.031]; R3 -0.025), and Exp12's raw PR2 clause is REVERSED (integrating concepts keep MORE early). C4 is marked NEW while Exp11 is null. For C1 (openness -> breadth), the nearest neighbours are Maillart et al. 2026 (concept-pair diffusion) and Cheng et al. 2023 (consistency -> volume, i.e. weighted edge persistence). The survivor beyond them is small: the home-only edge_persistence and NOV_res signal (-0.112, +0.134) on one cohort, with DL CI including 0 and no predictive gain. The report does not say this, and the Cheng sign-flip test Research 3 recommended was not run.
  Action: In 28, attach to each NEW or PARTIAL verdict the run's own evidence for and against: C3, the cohort attenuation and the PR2 reversal; C4, the Exp11 null. Write one paragraph stating what survives beyond Cheng 2023 and Maillart 2026: a home-only novelty / low-persistence partial association of about 0.08-0.13 on a 573-concept cohort, fragile at R4/R5, with no forecasting gain. Move RETENTION_RATIO_early in 31.2 to 'does not survive concept-type controls'.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Exp10 replication failures of earlier positive results are omitted. First, n_authors_early does NOT replicate for O3 (+0.014) or O1b (+0.036), although Exp8's only confirmed O3 indicator is recorded in 19.5b as positive. Second, the cohort O3 learned model is evaluable (evaluable = true in learned_models_cohort.json) and null: 0.540 vs B5 0.561, diff -0.021 [-0.130, 0.101]. Report 25.6 says 'not evaluable', and 19.7 still calls transience 'predictable beyond B5'. Third, CONTACT_REACH halves to +0.101 without intersection-born concepts, which the report does not mention anywhere. The per-group table for the Exp8 confirmed O2r indicators (heldout_unit_results.csv), required by the previous review and by the request ('within individual scientific fields'), is still absent.
  Action: Add Exp10's 'Leads replicated (secondary)' block verbatim. Correct 25.6's O3 row to -0.021 [-0.130, 0.101], evaluable, null, and add a '[Correction, iteration 4]' under 19.5b/19.7 noting the fresh-cohort non-replication. Add the per-group table (PHYS, LIFEENV, SOC, MATHDEC, COH_DEVHOME, COH_OTHER; psp [CI], n) for the 7 confirmed indicators, marking cells whose CI includes 0.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Coverage of the original request is partial, and the coverage table overstates it. Section 30 marks 'Strongest indicator analysis: Decomposition + case studies' and 'Case studies: Done', but the case studies are misreported. The request's step 1 (exploratory AI area inspected before fixing the method) exists only as Exp12's retrospective 37-concept AI atlas (ai_atlas/), which the report never mentions. RQ2's ordering question ('central within the original community first, or emerging at intersections') has a real null answer in Exp12 that is not reported. The 'why it works' analysis relies on Exp10's component table, but the table itself is not in the report. The Cheng-measure test, the degree-normalised ego density and survival-alongside-breadth are listed as open with no reason.
  Action: Correct Section 30 per cell, with the artifact behind each. Add rows for 'Exploratory AI stage' (Exp12 atlas, retrospective, outcome-selected), 'Home-first vs intersection ordering' (Exp12 sequence test, no signal beyond mechanical lag; Exp11 closure test null on DEV, incomplete) and 'Why it works' (Exp10 components: NOV_res and low persistence carry the home-only signal). Set the next iteration's priorities: finish Exp11 held-out and event study from the cached panel at zero credits, then run the Cheng consistency test on volume vs breadth.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Smaller slips. 27.4 calls the min-cp d0 = -0.021 'at the footprint control rung'; that rung does not exist in Exp7. 27.3 compares 21-subunit I2 0.43 with '0.66 over 6 units' while 27.2 gives 0.73 for the same headline; the artifact reports both, from different models, and this is not explained. The reference list was renumbered in iteration 4, so earlier citations point to wrong entries: [25] is now Shi & Evans instead of Pinheiro, and [28] Palla instead of Fernandes & Tang. Fernandes & Tang 2014 and Nomaler & Verspagen 2022 are cited but not listed.
  Action: Remove 'footprint control rung' and cite step2_heldout.json -> proximity sensitivity. Label the two I2 values by model. Keep one cumulative reference list with stable numbers and add the two missing entries.

<task>
Audit this research record. It is an internal report, not a paper: chronological, one
section per iteration, complete. Judge it on completeness, traceability and what it says
was learned — never on framing, section order or polish. When it claims a positive result,
novelty is evidence, not framing: check it against the nearest published neighbour (STEP 5),
not against how well the paper will read.

STEP 1 — READ THE REPORT: Read it carefully. Note what each iteration claims it did, found
and concluded.

STEP 2 — WALK THE ARTIFACTS: Go through the supplementary materials one artifact at a time
and find where the report reports it. Open the output files. Every executed artifact must
appear, and every table in those files must be in the report with its actual numbers. List
the misses; each one is a major issue.

STEP 3 — TRACE THE NUMBERS: For each number, table and claim in the report, find the
artifact it came from, and RECOMPUTE the headline number(s) yourself from that artifact's
own tables or result files rather than taking the report's figure on trust. Report any
mismatch as a finding, even when the underlying artifact is real. Where an artifact does
not let you recompute a number — the raw output is missing, or the computation cannot be
reproduced from what is there — say so and treat that claim as unverified rather than
accepted. An [ARTIFACT:id] marker or a named output file makes a number traceable; nothing
makes it untraceable, which is a major issue even when the number is right.

STEP 4 — CHECK COVERAGE AGAINST THE ORIGINAL REQUEST: The user's original request that
started this run is supplied as a separate message in this turn. Read it and ask what it
actually asked for. Is the run answering THAT, or a question next to it? Set `coverage`
to "full", "partial" or "lost", and when it is not "full", raise a critique naming the
part of the request that went unanswered. Judge against the request, not against the
report's own framing of it — a run that narrows one defensible step per iteration ends up
answering something nobody asked, and each step looked fine on its own.

STEP 5 — CHECK THE RECORD HOLDS TOGETHER:
- Is the REASONING written down at every step — why this strategy, why these artifacts,
  what the last review objected to, what the hypothesis revision concluded and why it moved?
  Outcomes with no account of why they were sought is a major issue.
- Are DEAD ENDS kept and labelled, with the evidence that killed them? A direction the
  artifacts show was tried and the report does not mention is a major issue.
- Is the CHRONOLOGY intact — one section per iteration, in order, earlier sections
  unchanged except where a correction is marked in place? A silently rewritten earlier
  section destroys the record.
- Are the numbers from artifacts that ACTUALLY RAN? Trace each one to an executed output. A
  projected, expected, illustrative or placeholder number presented as a result means
  `results_reported` is false.
- Is what the report concludes PROPORTIONATE to what it recorded? A tiny effect, or an
  effect in the direction everyone already expected, written up as the answer is either
  explained (a bound someone needed, a belief it overturns, a mechanism only visible at
  that size) or it overreaches, and you say so.
- When the report claims a POSITIVE, non-obvious result, name the nearest published result
  that already answers something close to it, and state what this iteration adds beyond
  that neighbour. A positive result earns no credit for novelty in this record until that
  comparison is made — its absence is a critique under `novelty`, not a paper-framing note.
- Does anything the report concludes CONTRADICT its own evidence — a table, a figure, a
  log, an artifact summary? Name the contradiction.
- A conclusion that contradicts the run's own evidence scores soundness 1.
- Set `blocking` by rule: true exactly when the soundness score is 1 or lower OR
  `results_reported` is false; otherwise false.

STEP 6 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (the record is incomplete or untraceable) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly, naming the artifact or section it is about
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Provide your review via structured output.

Research task: Exploring emerging scientific concepts through evolving knowledge networks
The objective of this task is to investigate whether temporal changes in the structure of scientific knowledge networks can reveal and explain the emergence of scientific concepts. The study should use an OpenAlex-based scholarly dataset, or a comparable large-scale publication dataset containing publication dates, textual metadata, disciplinary classifications, and, where useful, citation information.
Scientific emergence should be treated as a dynamic network process rather than simply as increasing popularity. A concept may emerge by acquiring new semantic or co-occurrence relations, becoming more structurally central, connecting previously separated research communities, or spreading from a specialized disciplinary context into a broader scientific landscape. The study should therefore identify which structural signals accompany or anticipate such changes and determine whether these signals generalize across scientific domains.
The study should address the following research questions:
RQ1: Which temporal network indicators reliably characterize and anticipate the emergence of scientific concepts across different scientific domains?
RQ2: How do emerging scientific concepts diffuse across disciplinary communities over time, and which network trajectories distinguish locally concentrated concepts from concepts that become broadly integrated into the scientific knowledge network?
A possible execution scenario is:
1.    Explore a focused set of concepts and network trajectories. Begin with one well-defined, rapidly evolving scientific area, for example Artificial Intelligence, and construct a semantically grounded temporal knowledge network for a manageable set of concepts. Inspect the network evolution openly before fixing the final methodology. Examine how known concepts change over time in terms of connectivity, new neighbors, community membership, centrality, and disciplinary distribution. Include concepts with visibly different trajectories: rapid emergence, gradual growth, local specialization, cross-disciplinary diffusion, and temporary expansion. The purpose of this stage is exploratory: identify which structural changes appear meaningful and which graph representations best capture them.
2.    Design a broad set of candidate emergence indicators. Based on the exploratory analysis and relevant literature on temporal networks, knowledge graphs, scientometrics, innovation diffusion, and community evolution, define a relatively large set of candidate indicators, for example 30--50 measures. These may include degree and weighted-degree growth, new-edge formation, edge persistence, neighborhood novelty, centrality change, community transitions, participation coefficient, brokerage, disciplinary reach, disciplinary entropy, diffusion velocity, and changes in local clustering. Include several simple concept-level temporal measures as reference points so that it is possible to determine whether sophisticated network information provides useful additional signal. The indicators should not all be minor variations of the same measure; they should reflect different aspects of network emergence.
3.    Test the indicators on a substantially wider collection of scientific domains and concepts. Apply all candidate indicators beyond the exploratory domain. Include fast- and slow-evolving fields, concepts originating in different scientific communities, concepts that remain discipline-specific, and concepts that subsequently become interdisciplinary. The evaluation should explicitly test whether indicators generalize across domains rather than working only in one field. Reserve complete scientific fields, time intervals, or concept groups as a held-out evaluation set that is not used when selecting or tuning the indicators. Selecting the best indicators and testing them on the same concepts would otherwise overestimate their usefulness.
4.    Define independent ground truth for scientific emergence and diffusion. Validation should not rely only on visual inspection of the constructed network or on a single operational definition of emergence. Establish several measurable outcomes representing different aspects of scientific emergence. These may include subsequent sustained publication uptake of a concept, future citation growth, expansion into previously unrelated subfields, persistence over several future periods, or externally documented recognition of a technology or research topic. Where feasible, use external sources such as scientific taxonomies, technology reports, review papers, curated emerging-topic lists, or other independent evidence. Emergence should not be defined only as rapid growth: a short-lived spike should not automatically be considered equivalent to persistent scientific integration. Similarly, a concept that becomes very frequent within one narrow subfield should be distinguishable from one that diffuses broadly across science.
5.    Identify and validate the strongest network indicators. Select the most promising indicators using only the development data, and evaluate approximately the 10 strongest measures on the held-out concepts/domains. Test their association with the ground-truth outcomes using correlation, ranking, or predictive evaluation as appropriate. Report results both globally and within individual scientific fields. The resampling unit should be clearly defined—for example concepts, subfields, or temporal windows—and results should be aggregated both across concepts and across domains. If an indicator performs well only in one domain, such as Artificial Intelligence, but fails to generalize to other scientific fields, this should be reported as an important negative result rather than averaged away.
6.    Use the strongest indicators to investigate RQ2 and derive diffusion trajectories. For concepts identified as emerging, analyze how their structural position changes over time. Study disciplinary reach, entropy, community transitions, brokerage, and cross-community connectivity. Rather than defining classes beforehand, derive recurring trajectories empirically. Possible outcomes may include localized emergence, rapid interdisciplinary diffusion, gradual network integration, transient expansion, or increasing structural brokerage. Examine whether there are systematic temporal sequences—for example whether concepts first become central within their original community and subsequently diffuse across disciplines, or whether some concepts emerge directly at the intersection of several communities.
Additional analysis -- explaining why the strongest indicators work. If one or more measures prove particularly robust, perform a detailed network analysis of what they are capturing. Identify which periods, network neighborhoods, edge types, communities, or structural transitions generate the signal. Representative concept case studies should be selected from the quantitative results and used to visualize these mechanisms.
Optional extension -- learned emergence model. Instead of relying exclusively on individual predefined metrics, train a small interpretable model using temporal network features to predict future emergence or diffusion outcomes. Compare it with the strongest individual indicators on the same held-out evaluation set. If the learned model performs substantially better, analyze which network features and temporal patterns it uses and whether these patterns have a meaningful interpretation in terms of scientific knowledge evolution.
Expected outcome
The expected outcome is not merely a list or ranking of emerging scientific concepts, but a validated framework for identifying and explaining scientific emergence through temporal network structure. The study should determine which network signals are robust across scientific domains, which signals are domain-specific, and how concepts transition from local research topics to broadly connected elements of the scientific knowledge network. 
We expect the final result as publication in the specific journal format mentioned above, in the structure that other papers from this journal have, with citations from the related work from the selected journal, with comparison to the related work.
