<research_methodology>
Write like a researcher keeping a lab notebook, not a chatbot summarizing bullet points and not
an author selling a paper. The publishable paper is written later, by a different step, out of
what you record here; anything you leave out is lost to it.

- Chronological, one section per iteration, in the order they ran. The shape of the document is the shape of the run.
- Ground every claim in specific artifacts and specific numbers. "Results show improvement" is empty — state effect sizes, baselines, and conditions, and reproduce the table they came from.
- Completeness beats selection: every experiment and every table, including the ones that went nowhere. Selection is the paper step's job and it cannot select what you did not write down.
- Be honest about what worked, what didn't, and why. A dead end is recorded as a dead end, with the evidence that killed it — never spun as "future work".
- No headline, no contribution claim, no abstract framing. Say what happened.
</research_methodology>

<safeguard_research_reporting>
When the research concerns bypassing or removing a model's safeguards (jailbreaks, refusal
removal, abliteration, safety fine-tuning reversal, or anything whose effect is a model that
refuses less on harmful requests), report the findings as MEASUREMENTS and their implications
for EVALUATION and DEFENCE, never as operational advice for defeating safeguards.
- State what was measured, on what, and how large the effect was, as in any other result.
- Draw the implications for the people who build and test safeguards: what an evaluation misses,
  which defences are brittle and where, what a safety evaluation should measure next.
- Never frame a finding as a recommendation, a recipe or a best configuration for removing
  refusals: no "the practical recommendation is to use X to remove refusals", no "for the
  strongest bypass, edit layers X to Y", no step-by-step settings a reader could follow to make a
  model comply with harmful requests.
- This applies everywhere the finding is stated: abstract, executive summary, key results, best
  result, discussion, conclusion, captions, the website and the interactive page.
</safeguard_research_reporting>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.
</system_reminder>

<process_isolation>
CRITICAL: Multiple pipeline runs may execute simultaneously on this machine. `ps aux | grep method.py` matches ALL runs, not just yours.
- NEVER kill processes by name (`killall`, `pkill -f`, `ps aux | grep ... | xargs kill`). This kills OTHER runs' processes.
- NEVER monitor processes by name (`ps aux | grep method.py`). You will see other runs' processes and get confused.
- ALWAYS use PID-based process management:
  Run: `uv run method.py & PID=$!` or `timeout <seconds> uv run method.py & PID=$!`
  Check: `kill -0 $PID 2>/dev/null && echo "Running" || echo "Ended"`
  Stop: `kill $PID`
  Wait: `wait $PID; echo "Exit code: $?"`
  Monitor: `tail -f logs/run.log & TAIL_PID=$!` then `kill $TAIL_PID` when done
</process_isolation>

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/4_gen_paper_repo/_4_assemble_paper/report_workspace`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/4_gen_paper_repo/_4_assemble_paper/report_workspace/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/4_gen_paper_repo/_4_assemble_paper/report_workspace/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/4_gen_paper_repo/_4_assemble_paper/report_workspace/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.
</disposable_outputs>

<task>
Typeset the run's internal research report as LaTeX and compile it to report.pdf. Then write
its executive summary, at most 4 pages, and compile it to exec_summary.pdf.
</task>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<report_rules>
This document is the run's INTERNAL RESEARCH REPORT. It is not the paper. A separate step writes
the publishable paper at the end of the run, out of this report, and it can only publish what it
can read here.

- CHRONOLOGICAL. One section per iteration, in order, under a heading that names the iteration.
  Earlier sections are not rewritten; they are the record of what was believed at the time.
- COMPLETE. EVERY experiment and EVERY table, in full. A result that exists in an artifact
  workspace and not here is a defect: open the output files and copy the numbers out of them.
  Never summarise a table away, never write "results were promising" in place of the table.
- REASONED. At every step, in the run's own words: why this strategy, why these artifacts, what
  the reviewer objected to and why, what the hypothesis update concluded and why it moved.
- DEAD ENDS KEPT, and labelled as dead ends, with the evidence that killed them. A direction that
  was abandoned is a finding; deleting it makes the run look luckier than it was.
- NO SELLING. No abstract framing, no contribution claims, no reaching for significance. A lab
  notebook written up: what was done, what came out, what it means, what is still open.
- NO SEEKING A POSITIVE RESULT. The report does not lead with the best number, and it does not
  arrange the evidence to flatter the run. A null result, a failed attempt and a confirmed effect
  are written up the same way and given the same room; the reader is a researcher who has to see
  what was thought, when, and on what basis, not a finding sold to them.
- EVERY NUMBER RECOMPUTED FROM THE ROWS. Any figure you state — in a table, in the text, in the
  closing section — is read out of the artifact's own output files, never copied from an earlier
  iteration's summary line. That line is what the run believed then; the files are what it has.
- READABLE AS A SEQUENCE. Tables and figures where they make the thinking easy to follow, each
  one placed in the iteration that produced it and captioned with what it was meant to settle.
- WRITTEN FOR A READER WHO WAS NOT THERE. Complete is not the same as raw. The prose is prose: a
  researcher who never saw the run reads it start to finish and follows what happened and why.
  The digits live in the tables and the captions; a sentence carries the COMPARISON, not the
  decimals ("the reranker halved tail latency, at a quarter of the throughput" — the table next
  to it has 4.6 s, 2.0 s, 118 qps, 31 qps). The aii-paper-writing skill's style rules are the
  house style here too: they are about how sentences work, not about selling a result, and a
  report written to them is still the complete, chronological, unsold record.

  Do temporal network signals predict how scientific concepts spread across disciplines?
abstract: >-
  New scientific concepts differ sharply in how broadly they spread across disciplines. We ask whether the early structure
  of a concept's topic cooccurrence network anticipates later cross-field breadth, beyond simple measures of volume and reach.
  Using the OpenAlex corpus, we identify 12,499 concepts, track 27,393 adoption episodes across 26 fields, and screen 53 early
  network indicators against a five-feature popularity baseline. Seven indicators survive held-out validation and compose
  into an openness index (OPEN) that measures a concept's early tendency to acquire novel, community-spanning cooccurrence
  partners. On a confirmatory cohort never used in selection, OPEN predicts size-adjusted breadth with partial Spearman correlation
  +0.17 (95% CI [+0.09, +0.25]). The signal is topical non-redundancy of the home neighbourhood, not temporal partner turnover:
  a within-concept permutation null absorbs the year-to-year churn, while the signal survives rarefaction and degree-preserving
  configuration nulls. Separately, a conditional logit on field-entry events confirms that concepts spread next to fields
  related to the ones currently retaining them, extending the principle of relatedness from economic complexity. These results
  suggest that the diversity of a concept's early intellectual neighbourhood, not its stability, distinguishes concepts destined

  \section{Introduction}

  Some scientific concepts remain confined to their home discipline for decades, while others cross field boundaries within a few years. Optogenetics, born in neuroscience, entered genetics, psychiatry and bioengineering; deep learning, rooted in computer science, now appears in medicine, materials science and linguistics. Understanding what distinguishes broadly spreading concepts from locally absorbed ones matters for science policy, research evaluation and the design of interdisciplinary programmes \citep{Rafols2009,Hofstra2019}. If early structural signals predict later cross-field integration, funders and institutions could identify concepts with high diffusion potential before that diffusion is observable in publication counts alone.

  The problem is hard because simple popularity metrics (publication volume, growth rate, share of papers outside the home field) already explain much of the variance in later breadth \citep{Rotolo2015,Singh2021}. Any network indicator must add information \emph{beyond} these baselines. Prior work has proposed several candidate signals, including community diversity of early adopters \citep{Weng2013}, collaboration density before emergence \citep{Salatino2017}, and structural variation in citation networks \citep{Salatino2018}. However, these studies typically operate on curated concept sets without held-out validation, mix concept-level and field-level units of analysis, or do not control for simple volume-based predictors. No prior study has screened a broad set of temporal knowledge-network indicators against a shared baseline on held-out field groups for the specific outcome of size-adjusted cross-disciplinary breadth.

  A second open question concerns the routes by which concepts move between fields. The principle of relatedness, established for regional economic diversification \citep{Hidalgo2007,Neffke2011,Pinheiro2021}, predicts that actors diversify into activities related to their existing portfolio. For scientific fields adopting new concepts, this principle has been tested for entry \citep{Hidalgo2018} but not for the role of currently \emph{retaining} fields, those that have adopted a concept and kept publishing on it. Whether concepts spread next to fields related to the ones currently retaining them, beyond relatedness to the home field alone, is untested.

  This paper addresses both questions with a large-scale empirical study. We identify 12{,}499 concepts from the OpenAlex bulk snapshot (476 million works, 2026-09-23), compute 53 early network indicators across six families, and test them on held-out field groups and a confirmatory onset cohort \footnote{Code: \url{https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-8795ea-concepts-spread-once-adopters-make-them/tree/fork/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/round-3/experiment-8}}. We also build a conditional logit model of field entry that tests whether retained-field relatedness predicts the next field a concept enters .

  \subsection*{Summary of contributions}

  \begin{itemize}
      \item We screen 53 early cooccurrence network indicators against a five-feature popularity baseline and confirm seven on held-out field groups for predicting rarefied cross-field breadth (Section~\ref{sec:rq1}).
      \item We introduce the OPEN index, a six-component composite of early cooccurrence openness, and confirm it on a 2015--2016 cohort never used in any selection step (Section~\ref{sec:open}).
      \item We show that early neighbourhood consolidation, measured by Cheng et al.'s (2023) ideational consistency, predicts volume growth but \emph{narrower} cross-field reach, a reversal that holds in all five field groups (Section~\ref{sec:cheng}).
      \item We confirm that concepts spread next to fields related to the ones currently retaining them ($d = 0.32$), extending the principle of relatedness (Section~\ref{sec:rq2}).
      \item We decompose breadth into exploration and retention channels and show that early contact diversity accounts for 73\% of the breadth gap (Section~\ref{sec:decomp}).
      \item We demonstrate that the openness--breadth association is topical non-redundancy, not temporal partner turnover (Section~\ref{sec:confound}).
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Related work}
  \label{sec:related}

  \textbf{Concept diffusion in science.} Cheng et al.\ (2023) tracked roughly 2{,}000 new ideas across Web of Science fields and found that early social reach, the number of disconnected researcher groups adopting an idea, was the strongest predictor of whether an idea became ``core.'' Their ideational consistency measure predicted next-year volume. \citet{Rotolo2015} defined emerging technologies through five attributes including novelty and fast growth but did not test cross-field spread. \citet{Salatino2017} showed that collaboration density rises before topic emergence. \citet{Krenn2019} forecast research trends from semantic networks. \citet{Singh2021} quantified the rise and fall of scientific fields using publication trajectories. None of these studies screened a broad indicator set against a shared baseline with held-out validation for the specific outcome of size-adjusted cross-field breadth.

  \textbf{Topic cooccurrence and citation networks.} \citet{Callon1991} introduced coword analysis as a tool for mapping the structure of research. \citet{Chavalarias2013} used phylomemetic methods to track how scientific fields branch and merge. \citet{Salatino2018} proposed the AUGUR system for forecasting topic emergence from cooccurrence backbone dynamics. Citation homophily across fields exceeds chance but has not been decomposed into background and concept-specific terms. \citet{Holmgren2023} tracked change in higher-order overlapping community structure in bibliometric networks.

  \textbf{Novelty, recombination and impact.} \citet{Uzzi2013} found that high-impact papers combine conventional and atypical journal pairings. \citet{Hofstra2019} documented the diversity--innovation paradox in science: researchers from underrepresented groups produce more novel work but receive fewer citations. \citet{Foster2013} distinguished tradition and innovation strategies in science. \citet{Tria2013} modelled the dynamics of correlated novelties, showing that novelty begets novelty through what they call the ``adjacent possible,'' the set of combinations reachable from the current state of knowledge. These studies operate at the paper level; ours operates at the concept level and asks about cross-field \emph{breadth} rather than citation impact.

  \textbf{The principle of relatedness.} \citet{Hidalgo2007} showed that a country's position in the product space predicts which products it diversifies into. \citet{Neffke2011} extended this to regional industry diversification, and \citet{Rigby2015} to knowledge space entry and exit. \citet{Hidalgo2018} formalised the principle of relatedness. \citet{Pinheiro2021} required sustained presence for diversification events. \citet{Bahar2014} showed that countries adopt products exported by their neighbours, a knowledge-diffusion channel for relatedness. Our contribution is to test whether relatedness to the set of fields currently \emph{retaining} a concept predicts entry, beyond relatedness to the home field and conventional density measures.

  \textbf{Community structure and virality.} \citet{Weng2013} showed that early community diversity predicts virality of online content (AUC 0.83). \citet{Ugander2012} found that structural diversity, defined as the number of connected components among an adopter's neighbours who have adopted, drives social contagion on Facebook. \citet{Centola2010} demonstrated experimentally that complex contagions require reinforcement from multiple communities. \citet{Palla2007} tracked the evolution of overlapping communities in large networks. \citet{Burt2004} showed that structural holes, brokerage positions spanning disconnected groups, generate good ideas. Our indicator screen tests the scholarly analogue of these mechanisms: whether a concept's early cooccurrence partners spanning multiple communities predicts later cross-field breadth.

  \section{Data and methods}
  \label{sec:methods}

  \subsection{Concept identification and panel construction}

  We use the OpenAlex bulk snapshot (2026-09-23; 476{,}196{,}327 works; 129.4 million base works 1995--2022). Concepts are identified by Aho--Corasick title matching of 56{,}643 legacy OpenAlex concepts (levels 2--5) plus Wikidata aliases, with stemmed verification . A per-concept LLM precision gate drops concepts with precision below 0.80.

  A concept's \emph{onset year} $t_0$ is the first year it reaches 20 grounded publications. \emph{Home field(s)} are the field(s) holding at least 40\% of the first 30 grounded papers. The specification was frozen on DEV data (hash-sealed before held-out scoring) and unsealed once. The panel comprises 12{,}499 concepts and 27{,}393 concept-by-field adoption episodes (Table~\ref{tab:panel}).

  \begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Panel composition. DEV concepts have home fields in Computer Science, Engineering, Biochemistry/Genetics/Medicine. Held-out groups cover the remaining field families.}
  \label{tab:panel}
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
  \toprule
  Split & Concepts & Episodes \\
  \midrule
  DEV (CS/Eng/BGM/Med, onset 2003--2009) & 4{,}771 & 9{,}079 \\
  Cohort (onset 2010--2014, all fields) & 4{,}356 & 9{,}799 \\
  Held-out Physical Sciences & 742 & 1{,}662 \\
  Held-out Life \& Environment & 1{,}113 & 3{,}099 \\
  Held-out Social Sciences & 1{,}352 & 3{,}320 \\
  Held-out Math \& Decision Sci. & 165 & 434 \\
  \midrule
  \textbf{Total} & \textbf{12{,}499} & \textbf{27{,}393} \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  \subsection{Outcome: rarefied field breadth}

  The primary outcome is \emph{rarefied field breadth} $O_{2r}$ ($m = 50$): the expected number of distinct venue fields among a fixed-size random draw of $m$ papers from a concept's publications in years $t_0 + 6$ to $t_0 + 8$, computed by exact hypergeometric rarefaction. Rarefaction separates size-adjusted breadth from sheer volume: a concept with 10{,}000 papers in one field scores lower than a concept with 200 papers spread across six fields. Secondary outcomes include sustained uptake ($O_{1c}$, binary: concept still active at $t_0 + 8$), transience ($O_3$, binary: concept drops below 5 papers by $t_0 + 8$), and field- and year-normalised citation growth ($O_4$).

  [FIGURE:fig_outcomes]

  \subsection{Baseline and indicator families}

  We define a \emph{five-feature baseline} consisting of log early volume, publication growth, non-home share, Shannon entropy and field reach, all computed over $t_0$ to $t_0 + 2$. The 53 candidate indicators span six families: cooccurrence ego-network topology (27 indicators: degree, density, persistence, novelty, community counts), popularity and volume (6), disciplinary spread (3), retained frontier (7: contact reach, retention ratio, densities), gateway centrality on the field backbone (7), and coauthor reach (3).

  \subsection{The OPEN index}

  The OPEN index is the mean of six signed $z$-scored ego-network components from the early window ($t_0$ to $t_0 + 2$):

  \begin{enumerate}
      \item New edge rate (positive sign): the fraction of a concept's cooccurrence neighbours that are new.
      \item Number of Leiden communities reached ($n_{\text{comm}}$, positive): how many distinct topic communities a concept's neighbours span.
      \item Participation coefficient (positive): the share of a concept's ties that cross community boundaries.
      \item Neighbourhood novelty residual (NOV$_{\text{res}}$, positive): the novelty of a concept's cooccurrence partners after residualising on degree.
      \item Ego density (negative sign): the density of the concept's local cooccurrence subgraph.
      \item Edge persistence (negative sign): the fraction of the concept's neighbours retained across windows.
  \end{enumerate}

  The $z$-score constants are frozen from the DEV data. We test three builds: OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ (home-field cooccurrence graph only), OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ (corpus-wide graph), and OPEN$_{\text{sizematch}}$ (corpus-wide papers subsampled to home counts).

  \subsection{Statistical framework}

  Indicator screening uses \emph{partial Spearman priority} (PSP): the Pearson correlation of rank-transformed indicator and outcome residuals, both residualised on the baseline covariates and control rungs. Inference uses 2{,}000 concept-level bootstrap resamples with refit . Pooling across field groups uses the DerSimonian--Laird random-effects estimator \citep{Dersimonian1986} with $I^2$ heterogeneity reporting \citep{Higgins2002}. Multiple comparisons use Holm correction across the pre-declared family.

  We also define NOVCHURN as the mean of $z$(NOV$_{\text{res}}$) and $-z$(edge persistence), a two-component novelty/churn measure used in mechanism analyses.

  For the field-entry analysis, we use a conditional logit on concept-year risk sets, where each concept-year stratum includes all non-home fields not yet entered, and the event is entry (at least 2 cumulative grounded papers). The entry baseline includes relatedness to home, log field size, density over all ever-entered fields, and the target field's own eigenvector centrality on the topic-relatedness backbone.

  \section{Results: indicator screen}
  \label{sec:rq1}

  \subsection{Held-out indicator screen}

  The top 10 indicators selected on DEV by partial Spearman priority were tested once on four held-out field groups and two cohort splits . Seven are confirmed with $p < 0.05$ after Holm correction for multiple comparisons and 95\% CI excluding zero (Table~\ref{tab:screen}).

  The confirmed indicators span two families: relatedness (end-of-window field density, volume-weighted field density, contact reach, retention ratio) and cooccurrence topology (community count, neighbourhood novelty residual, ego density). No centrality or volume-only indicator survives. Two confirmed indicators carry negative signs: the early retention ratio (concepts with higher early field retention spread \emph{less} broadly) and ego density (concepts with denser cooccurrence neighbourhoods spread less).

  An ElasticNet combining all indicators adds Spearman +0.059 [+0.046, +0.073] over the five-feature baseline on held-out groups; an Explainable Boosting Machine adds +0.052 [+0.037, +0.067].

  [FIGURE:fig_rq1_confirmed]

  \subsection{Pre-onset footprint}
  \label{sec:footprint}

  We define a concept's \emph{pre-onset footprint} as the publication presence of its name in fields other than the home field before its onset year $t_0$. About half of the end-of-window field density and volume-weighted field density signal comes from this footprint. On held-out data, the postonset-only field density drops from +0.374 to +0.187 [+0.145, +0.246] and the volume-weighted variant drops from +0.317 to +0.176 [+0.114, +0.227]. The postonset components remain clearly positive, but these indicators are partly legacy presence, not purely early network dynamics.

  [FIGURE:fig_full_screen]

  \subsection{Confirmatory cohort test of the OPEN index}
  \label{sec:open}

  The OPEN index was confirmed on a 2015--2016 onset cohort never used in any prior screen . We define a six-rung \emph{control ladder} that tests OPEN's partial Spearman with rarefied breadth under increasingly demanding baselines (Table~\ref{tab:ladder}). Each rung adds a covariate set: the first rung adds the five-feature baseline plus onset year; subsequent rungs add contact reach, concept type, pre-onset footprint, label coverage and home-group fixed effects, in that order.

  \begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{OPEN index control ladder on the 2015--2016 confirmatory cohort. PSP = partial Spearman priority with rarefied breadth ($O_{2r}$, $m = 50$), 95\% concept-bootstrap CI.}
  \label{tab:ladder}
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{lccccccc}
  \toprule
  Build & R0 & R1 & R2 & R3 & R4 & R5 & $n$ \\
  \midrule
  OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ & \small{+.12} & \small{+.10} & \small{+.09} & \small{+.08} & \small{+.07} & \small{+.06} & 573 \\
  OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ & \small{+.21} & \small{+.18} & \small{+.17} & \small{+.17} & \small{+.15} & \small{+.14} & 630 \\
  OPEN$_{\text{size}}$ & \small{+.18} & \small{+.15} & \small{+.15} & \small{+.14} & \small{+.12} & \small{+.11} & 591 \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ and OPEN$_{\text{sizematch}}$ survive all six rungs with confidence intervals excluding zero. OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ passes the primary concept-type rung (PSP = +0.091, 95\% CI [+0.013, +0.171]) but its DerSimonian--Laird pooled interval includes zero (+0.083 [$-$0.007, +0.173]), making the home-only signal marginal. The paired difference OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ minus OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ at the footprint rung is +0.093 [+0.016, +0.169], confirming that cross-field cooccurrence carries information beyond home-field structure.

  A specification curve across 1{,}920 specifications (120 composites $\times$ 4 outcomes $\times$ 4 control sets) shows 99.7\% of specifications with confidence intervals above zero (permutation $p$ = 0.005).

  [FIGURE:fig_open_ladder]

  \subsection{Vocabulary-free confirmation (Frame~N)}

  To address survivorship bias in the legacy concept vocabulary, we mined 636 vocabulary-free phrase-born concepts from random title samples (2003--2015 onsets), excluding all legacy labels and previously scored concepts . These vocabulary-free newborns have 14\% lower breadth and 89\% higher transience than legacy concepts, confirming that curated vocabularies are survivor-selected.

  On these newborns, OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ gives PSP +0.117 [+0.020, +0.218] at the pre-onset footprint rung for $O_{2r}$ ($m = 30$). The signal is carried primarily by neighbourhood novelty: the novelty residual alone gives +0.208 [+0.113, +0.303], while edge persistence is null ($-$0.013). Pooling the independent Frame~N result with the legacy cohort, weighted by the inverse of each estimate's variance, gives +0.096 [+0.034, +0.158] at the footprint rung.

  [FIGURE:fig_frame_n]

  \subsection{The consistency--breadth reversal}
  \label{sec:cheng}

  Cheng et al.'s (2023) ideational consistency is the cosine similarity of a concept's neighbour co-usage vector from year $t-1$ to $t$. We rebuilt the measure on OpenAlex topic co-usage for 12{,}311 concepts (105{,}839 concept-years) . In their design (next-year volume, no current-size control), the negative-binomial model reproduces their estimate: $b = 0.428$ (+53.5\%/SD). Adding current volume log $V(t)$ removes almost all of it: +1.3\% [+0.5\%, +2.1\%], a residual-to-raw ratio of 0.021 [0.009, 0.035]. The volume effect is almost entirely a proxy for current size.

  As an early trait, consistency predicts \emph{narrower} cross-field reach. Net of the five-feature baseline, the partial Spearman with rarefied breadth is $-$0.069 [$-$0.093, $-$0.047] on the pooled bodies (DerSimonian--Laird over five field groups: $-$0.079, $I^2$ = 0.00, 5/5 groups negative), replicating on the 2015--2017 cohort ($-$0.111 [$-$0.197, $-$0.030]). The consistency measure has Spearman +0.79 with edge persistence; it is essentially weighted persistence, confirming that a stable neighbourhood predicts growth but not breadth.

  [FIGURE:fig_cheng_reversal]

  \section{Results: field entry and trajectories}
  \label{sec:rq2}

  \subsection{Retained-field relatedness predicts the next field entered}

  A conditional logit on concept-year risk sets tests whether relatedness to the fields currently retaining a concept predicts which field it enters next . We define a field as ``retaining'' a concept when it has published at least two grounded papers on the concept in each of the two most recent years. Relatedness between fields is measured by pointwise mutual information (PMI) of topic coassignment on the field-level backbone.

  On an independent frame of 11{,}841 concepts (6{,}978 entry events in 6{,}076 informative strata), the pooled held-out standardised coefficient is $d_0$ = 0.322 [0.291, 0.355] with LR = 325.8 ($p < 10^{-70}$). The effect is substantial but heterogeneous across field families: Life \& Environment shows the strongest signal (+0.401) and Mathematics \& Decision Sciences is null (+0.065). DerSimonian--Laird pooled $d_0$ = 0.243 [0.118, 0.368], $I^2$ = 0.92.

  Retained-field relatedness survives both the conventional revealed-comparative-advantage density ($D_{\text{rca}}$) and a share-weighted current presence density: adding $d_0$ after both rivals gives LR = 29.3 ($p = 6.1 \times 10^{-8}$) on DEV, and $D_{\text{rca}}$ is absorbed once $d_0$ enters. All three specificity tests reject their nulls after Holm correction. A dose-response by retention age shows a monotone pattern (2 years: +0.056; 3 years: +0.103; $\geq$4 years: +0.251).

  However, the volume-matched contrast is null on held-out data (Holm $p$ = 0.76), and the effect is backbone-specific: under minimum conditional probability proximity instead of PMI, $d_0 = -0.021$. We cannot fully separate persistence from sustained volume as a predictor of field entry.

  [FIGURE:fig_field_entry]

  \subsection{Gateway centrality does not predict field retention}

  An initial 80-episode panel suggested that a field's eigenvector centrality on the topic-relatedness backbone predicts retention ($\Delta$AUC +0.103) \footnote{Code: \url{https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-8795ea-concepts-spread-once-adopters-make-them/tree/fork/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/round-1/experiment-4}}. On the full panel of 27{,}393 episodes, gateway centrality adds $\Delta$AUC $-$0.00001 (95\% CI [$-$0.0006, +0.0003]) . The signal vanishes once the field's leave-concept-out retention propensity is controlled. The shuffled-$R$ placebo's 95th percentile (0.130) exceeds the original +0.103, so the original lead cannot be certified as above chance on 80 episodes.

  \section{Breadth decomposition and mechanism}
  \label{sec:decomp}

  \subsection{Exploration drives breadth, not retention}

  Rarefied breadth $B_n$ can be decomposed as $\log B_n = \log E_2 + \log M + \log \rho$, where $E_2$ is early contact diversity (number of fields reached in the first three years), $M$ is the frontier advance ratio (new fields entered after the early window), and $\rho$ is the retention rate (fraction of early-contact fields that remain active). On 3{,}188 DEV concepts :

  \begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{Breadth decomposition ($\log B_n = \log E_2 + \log M + \log \rho$): share of the top-versus-bottom tercile gap in rarefied breadth attributable to each component.}
  \label{tab:decomp}
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
  \toprule
  Component & Share & 95\% CI \\
  \midrule
  Exploration ($s_{\text{E2}} + s_M$) & 0.732 & [0.703, 0.764] \\
  \quad Early contact diversity ($s_{\text{E2}}$) & 0.779 & [0.738, 0.818] \\
  Retention ($s_\rho$) & 0.268 & [0.236, 0.297] \\
  Difference (explore $-$ retain) & 0.464 & [0.407, 0.528] \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  Broad concepts start with wider contact, not by advancing a wider frontier: the frontier advance component is negative ($s_M = -0.046$ [$-$0.074, $-$0.017]).

  [FIGURE:fig_decomp]

  \subsection{Which partners carry the signal?}
  \label{sec:confound}

  The home-only signal is carried by partners from new Leiden communities that arrive through mixed-field papers, those with at least one off-home topic . In a Shapley decomposition of the NOVCHURN partial Spearman:

  \begin{itemize}
      \item Partners from new communities carry the signal (contrast $C_2$ = +0.102 [+0.069, +0.133], Holm $p$ = 0.003).
      \item Partners carried by mixed-field papers carry the signal ($C_4$ = +0.103 [+0.071, +0.134], Holm $p$ = 0.003).
      \item Novelty among substantive-domain partners, not among methodological partners, is the main contributor (domain Shapley $\phi$ = +0.132 on the 2015--2017 cohort, method = +0.012).
  \end{itemize}

  We call a home paper that introduces at least one cooccurrence partner from a previously unrepresented Leiden community a \emph{bridging paper}. Controlling for the share of early home papers that are bridging papers halves the NOVCHURN partial from 0.118 to 0.056. These bridging papers have more first-time authors on the concept (+5 percentage points) and far more off-home topics (+25 points).

  [FIGURE:fig_mechanism]

  \subsection{Topical non-redundancy, not temporal turnover}

  Raw edge persistence has Spearman +0.72 with log home-paper count . We tested three confound-correction variants:

  \textbf{Fixed-size rarefaction.} Subsampling to 10 home papers per year retains 68\% of the pooled association. The bias-corrected Chao estimator of the Jaccard index retains 91\%.

  \textbf{Within-concept permutation null.} The excess churn over a 200-draw within-concept year-label permutation null is indistinguishable from zero: excess NOVCHURN pooled PSP = +0.008 [$-$0.02, +0.03], compared to raw NOVCHURN = +0.116 [+0.09, +0.14]. The $R^2$ of raw persistence on this permutation-null mean is 0.66. What predicts breadth is a static property, the non-redundancy of the concept's home-topic partner mix, not year-to-year turnover.

  \textbf{Degree-preserving configuration null.} Replacing raw ego density and persistence by their curveball configuration $z$-scores raises OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ from +0.092 to +0.115 on the same sample.

  Split-half reliability of NOVCHURN$_{\text{raw}}$ is 0.48, rising to 0.67 at $\geq$100 home papers. The disattenuated pooled NOVCHURN$_{\text{raw}}$ PSP is 0.178 [0.141, 0.214].

  [FIGURE:fig_confound]

  \section{Discussion}
  \label{sec:disc}

  \subsection{What the OPEN index captures}

  The OPEN index captures the degree to which a concept's early neighbourhood acquires partners from diverse communities rather than reinforcing existing ones. The signal is not temporal turnover but topical non-redundancy. A within-concept permutation null absorbs the year-to-year component, yet the association persists: concepts whose home-field cooccurrence partners span many communities and arrive through papers with off-home topics tend to reach more fields later. This is consistent with \citet{March1991}'s exploration--exploitation distinction at the concept level: concepts embedded in a diverse, open intellectual neighbourhood are better positioned for cross-field diffusion than those embedded in a dense, self-referential one.

  The home-only signal (OPEN$_{\text{home}}$) is marginal. The stronger OPEN$_{\text{all}}$ signal is partly mechanically coupled: early off-home papers that enter the ego network are a subset of the papers that determine the outcome. OPEN$_{\text{sizematch}}$ (corpus-wide papers subsampled to home counts) controls for this coupling and remains significant.

  \subsection{The consistency--breadth reversal}

  Cheng et al.\ (2023) found that ideational consistency predicts a concept becoming ``core.'' We replicate their result for volume (+53\%/SD) but show that, net of volume, the same property predicts \emph{narrower} cross-field reach. The reversal holds in all five field groups ($I^2 = 0$), replicates on a fresh cohort, and is a between-concept trait (within concepts, a more consistent year is followed by slightly \emph{more} entries). The features predictive of local consolidation and growth (stable terminology, consistent co-usage patterns) are distinct from, and partly opposed to, the features predictive of broad disciplinary spread. This distinction matters for policy: a concept ``becoming core'' in the sense of rising in volume and stable terminology may be deepening within its home community rather than spreading across fields.

  \subsection{Background homophily in citation lineage}

  A methodological finding from the lineage analysis merits attention \footnote{Code: \url{https://github.com/ai-inventor-papers/ai-invention-8795ea-concepts-spread-once-adopters-make-them/tree/fork/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/round-1/experiment-1}}. Among 48 concepts in the citation-lineage experiment, 100\% have a positive background log-odds ratio: every field's citing papers preferentially cite their own field above chance. The $R^2$ of the raw concept-lineage log-odds ratio on the background log-odds ratio is 0.66 (90\% CI [0.39, 0.83]). Two-thirds of the between-concept variance in raw lineage autonomy is general disciplinary homophily, not concept-specific integration. Uniform-null lineage indices conflate field composition with concept-specific rooting. This extends \citet{Lipsitch2010}'s negative-control framework from epidemiology to bibliometric mixing tables.

  \subsection{Retained-field relatedness}

  The confirmed field-entry result ($d_0 = 0.32$ on the independent frame) extends the principle of relatedness from economic complexity \citep{Hidalgo2007,Neffke2011} to concept adoption. No prior study has tested whether relatedness to the set of fields currently \emph{retaining} a concept predicts entry, beyond relatedness to the home field. The result is partial: the volume-matched contrast is null, and the effect is backbone-specific. But $d_0$ survives both the conventional density and a volume-density rival, with a monotone dose-response by retention age.

  \subsection{Limitations}

  \textbf{Effect size.} The OPEN--breadth association is modest. OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ adds no forecasting gain over the five-feature baseline (+0.002 [$-$0.003, +0.008]). The cross-validated Spearman of the baseline alone is 0.79; adding all indicators raises it by about 0.03. The practical predictive gain from early network structure is small.

  \textbf{Measurement noise.} Split-half reliability of OPEN$_{\text{home}}$ is 0.49. The signal is measured with substantial noise at typical sample sizes (median $\sim$30 home papers in the early window). Prediction for individual concepts remains imprecise.

  \textbf{Vocabulary bias.} The legacy OpenAlex concept vocabulary is survivor-selected. The Frame~N panel is small (448 concepts), with pre-unseal power of only 0.47.

  \textbf{Cooccurrence, not causation.} Early ego-network openness could reflect the concept's intrinsic generality, the diversity of the research community around it, or the breadth of the problems it addresses. We show association, not mechanism.

  \textbf{Domain heterogeneity.} Life \& Environment Sciences show the weakest OPEN signal (PSP +0.071 vs.\ +0.186 for the other five units pooled). The retained-field relatedness effect has $I^2 = 0.92$, indicating substantial cross-domain heterogeneity.

  \section{Conclusion}

  We screened 53 early temporal network indicators for predicting the cross-disciplinary breadth of new scientific concepts, using 12{,}499 concepts from the OpenAlex corpus with held-out validation. Seven indicators are confirmed, composing into an openness index that captures topical non-redundancy in a concept's early cooccurrence neighbourhood. Early openness predicts breadth; early consolidation predicts volume but not breadth. Concepts spread next to fields related to those currently retaining them, extending the principle of relatedness.

  The practical forecasting gain from early network structure is small next to simple popularity baselines. The conceptual contribution, however, is that openness and consolidation have opposing associations with breadth and volume. This clarifies that growing deeper within a home discipline and spreading wider across disciplines are not the same process, and the network signatures that predict one do not predict the other.

title: >-
  Early co-occurrence network openness predicts cross-disciplinary concept breadth: evidence from 12,499 scientific concepts
abstract: >-
  We ask which early structural signals in a concept's topic co-occurrence network anticipate later cross-field breadth. Using
  the OpenAlex bulk snapshot, we identify 12,499 concepts by title matching across 26 scientific fields, track 27,393 adoption
  episodes, and screen 53 early network indicators from six families against a five-feature popularity baseline on held-out
  field groups. Seven indicators survive held-out validation and compose into an openness index (OPEN) that measures a concept's
  early tendency to acquire novel, community-spanning co-occurrence partners; two of the seven carry negative signs. The Eval4
  descriptive pool of OPEN_home over 6 non-selection bodies gives partial Spearman +0.069 [95% CI +0.038, +0.100], I-squared
  = 0, 6/6 positive; evidence state is lead. The association behaves like a static topical-dispersion property of the home
  neighbourhood: temporal turnover is untested rather than refuted (V2 excess split-half reliability below 0.05). A within-concept
  closure test is null on development data and opposite-signed on held-out fields. Separately, on the Exp7 independent frame
  (EXP5 minus EXP6; 11,841 concepts, 6,978 entry events in 6,076 informative strata), a conditional logit on field-entry events
  shows that concepts spread next to fields related to the ones currently retaining them: d0 = 0.322 [0.291, 0.355]. The pre-registered
  verdict is FRONTIER = PARTIAL: the volume-matched contrast is null and the coefficient reverses under minimum-conditional-probability
  proximity. Early contact diversity accounts for most of the breadth gap; no discrete trajectory typology passes the naming
  rule.

  summary: |-
    Screen of candidate L, the background-adjusted naturalisation gap A*_h, on the frozen P78 dev panel. Headline: it does NOT survive the pre-registered rule.
    PANEL: 48 dev concepts (Biochem 13, CS 21, Engineering 3, Medicine 11). Dropped: 22 with t0 outside 2003-2009 and 8 with a sealed home field.
    RULE CLAUSES:
    - LOGO Delta-rho for O2r over B5 = -0.006, 90% concept-bootstrap CI [-0.034, 0.017]; rho_B5 = 0.834. FAIL.
    - Positive left-out groups: 0 of 4. FAIL.
    - Split-half reliability (Spearman-Brown) = 0.58. FAIL (bar 0.6).
    - Abs Spearman with log early volume / early growth = 0.14 / 0.18. PASS.
    OTHER RESULTS:
    - A*_h's within-field sign flips: Medicine +0.45, CS -0.18.
    - Field-level rho*_cj -> R_j: Delta-AUC +0.002, CI [-0.011, 0.016], over 367 units.
    - O1 uptake: Delta-AUC -0.026. O3 transience is degenerate (4 positives of 48).
    - M1: R^2 of raw lineage log-OR on background log-OR = 0.66; the background log-OR is positive for 48/48 concepts. Raw lineage is mostly homophily.
    - Reliability vs n: 0.72 only above 60 off-home children. On those 11 concepts Delta-rho = +0.118, CI [0, 0.355], underpowered.
    - REML tau_c = 0.29, tau_cj = 0.65. PyMC NUTS check passes (Spearman 0.9996 with REML).
    - None of the 14 candidate and foil features, scored as exploratory candidates, beats B5.
    DATA DEVIATION: the shared OpenAlex credit pool ran dry (139 own credits spent). Yearly counts (t0, O1, O3, volume, growth) are OpenAlex S0 exactly. Field labels, concept papers, citation lineage and background-reference fields come from free Semantic Scholar data: fractional s2-fos text-classifier fields. Child reference lists come from free OpenAlex singleton GETs. The S2 and OpenAlex O2r agree with Spearman 0.87 on 11 concepts.
    AUDIT (audit/rederive.py, independent code paths): Delta-rho, rho_B, the size correlations, O1 Delta-AUC and M1 are re-derived exactly; field-level Delta-AUC is 0.0020. A shuffled-A*_h placebo passes 0 of 200 times. Power caveat: with rho_B5 = 0.83, a feature needs Spearman of about 0.95 or more with O2r to pass the Delta >= 0.10 clause. Reliability 0.58 was NOT independently re-derived.
    FILES: results/features.csv, field_features.csv, outcomes.csv, field_outcomes.csv, screen_result.json (all statistics and deviations), screen_table.csv (OOF predictions), dropped.csv, audit/rederive_out.json. method_out.json follows exp_gen_sol_out and holds per-concept B5 and B5+A*_h predictions plus field-retention units.

    works in the 2026-09-23 OpenAlex S3 snapshot. Venue-field compositions (home, O2r, R_j, entropy) and ego topics use title-matched
    works (median 48% of API volume; rho 0.88). Backbone: full-corpus topic PMI per slice (2000-04/05-09/10-14), Leiden gamma=3
    (25/26/23 communities; the plan rule gave about 8, reported as D_q). D_z failed the T3 size diagnostic (rho with log volume
    -0.63), so the pre-declared fallback D_ratio is the primary D. RESULTS (LOGO ridge, 2,000 stratified concept bootstraps):
    B5 alone reaches rho 0.770 with O2r. D_ratio delta-rho +0.006 [90% CI -0.092, 0.135], 3/4 groups positive, SB 0.83. F_res
    delta-rho -0.060 [-0.158, 0.014], 1/4 groups positive, SB 0.44. No candidate survives the pre-registered rule; D is carried
    forward as the best available result and the null is reported. Dissociation tests are inconclusive; O3 is not estimable
    (all transient concepts are Medicine); field-level R_j dAUC is about 0. Portability: D_ratio, D_rare, participation and
    NOV_res are associated with O2r in all 4 groups (rho 0.45-0.63) but are redundant under delta-rho. Degree, strength and
    new-edge growth are CS-only (a negative result). EXPLORATORY: the out-of-group partial rho of D_ratio given B5 is 0.335
    [0.02, 0.65], permutation p=0.037; delta-rho is near its ceiling because B5 is already strong. Audit: all headline numbers
    re-derived exactly by independent code; the placebo fails and the planted control passes. Files: results/outcomes.csv,
    field_outcomes.csv, features.csv (about 30 indicators), screen_result.json, exploratory_partial_association.json, audit.json,

  title: Where a concept lands early vs how broadly it spreads
  summary: >-
    Screen of candidate G (gateway landing) on the frozen P78 dev panel under protocol S0. This artifact is also the AUTHORITATIVE
    producer of the shared outcome tables: outcomes.csv (all 78 rows; O1 uptake, O2r rarefied venue-field breadth m=30/50,
    O2r_resid, O2_raw, O3 transience, t0, newborn flag, home, group, label coverage, trunc flag), field_outcomes.csv (80 concept
    x off-home-field retention rows), features.csv (G family, ~20 simple reference indicators, B5 columns) and single_indicators.csv
    (pooled, per-group and DerSimonian-Laird Spearman/AUC with I2). RESULTS: 46 dev concepts (34 with an outcome window).
    Leave-one-home-group-out ridge, B5 vs B5+G on O2r: Delta-rho=+0.033, 90% CI [-0.095,0.168], positive in 2/4 groups, so
    G does NOT survive the pre-registered rule, although reliability (r_SB=0.92) and the size check (|rho|<=0.13) pass. Secondary:
    O2r residualised on log N gives Delta-rho=+0.15, CI90 [0.000,0.321], 4/4 groups. O1 Delta-AUC=+0.072, CI90 [0.00,0.16].
    O3 is not evaluable (2 positives). Field level: the adopting field's gateway centrality adds +0.10 AUC for retention,
    95% CI [0.03,0.17], and survives a field-size control (not in CS). Next-field entry: relatedness density AUC 0.61 beats
    the permutation null (p=0.023) but loses to log field size (0.74); in conditional logit, density still adds signal. CAVEATS:
    the shared OpenAlex key hit its 1,000-credit floor after 286 credits, so the t0+3..t0+4 labels are missing (label-based
    B5 parts use t0..t0+2), outcome windows keep only the top-200 sources (29/34 truncated), and insularity, SLICE_B and P5
    were not computed. The backbone is 1998-2002 topic co-assignment PMI over 26 fields (field_backbone.json). Cache is frozen
    in cache/raw.

  title: Do hub fields keep new concepts? Held-out test
  summary: |-
    Sealed held-out test of H1 (does the adopting field's frozen 1998-2002 eigenvector gateway centrality predict retention of a newly adopted concept beyond B5, field size, phi(home,j), relatedness density, the field's leave-concept-out retention propensity P_j(-c), coverage and episode size?) and H3 (does gateway-weighted early landing G predict size-adjusted breadth O2r_resid given B5?).

    Data: one zero-credit scan of all 2,040 OpenAlex S3 works files (2026-09-23; 476,196,327 works; 129.4M base works 1995-2022), with Aho-Corasick title matching of 56,643 legacy concepts (levels 2-5) plus Wikidata aliases and stemmed verification: 60.0M verified matches. Grounding: legacy-tag rule TAG (test P 0.947, R 0.659), chosen on a 390-pair LLM benchmark with 60 hand-checked pairs (90% agreement), plus a per-concept LLM precision gate ($2.28 of OpenRouter).

    Authoritative S1 tables for iteration 3: frame_concepts.csv (12,499 concepts: DEV 4,771, held-out PHYS/LIFEENV/SOC/MATHDEC 742/1,113/1,352/165, cohort 4,356), episodes.csv (27,393 concept x off-home-field episodes with R and the R_abs1-3 sensitivity outcomes for all splits), concept_outcomes.csv (O1, O3, O2r_m30/m50) and concept_features_basic.csv (G, G_A, G_btw, REL_home, RS, DOM_*, count/label indicators, B5).

    The spec was frozen on DEV (sha256 in logs/seal.log) and unsealed once. H1: held-out dAUC -0.00001 [-0.0006, +0.0003] (DEV +0.00001), DL pooled -0.00004 (I2 = 0), cohort -0.0001. The placebo was not exceeded and the conditional logit is null. Verdict: DISCONFIRMED. Power: the minimum detectable dAUC is 0.004. The relatedness pair beats gateway on held-out (+0.0034 [0.0010, 0.0051] vs 0). The baseline ladder shows gateway's DEV signal (+0.0019 over the iteration-1 base) vanishes once P_j(-c) is added, and reverses on held-out (-0.0016). Gateway alone has AUC 0.605 on DEV vs 0.506 on held-out (0.41 in SOC): gateway is a domain-specific proxy for 'fields that keep things'. Iteration-1 replication: +0.023 (vs +0.10). H3: held-out partial rho G 0.030 / G_A 0.026 / G_btw 0.046 (Holm p = 0.0045); within-group DL pooled G 0.068 [0.029, 0.107]. The effect is small; the tests show 0/40 false positives on shuffled outcomes. REL_home is strongly negative (-0.14).

    An independent audit (sklearn, own AUC) matches to 1e-6. Deviations: no OpenAlex API audit or insularity (credits exhausted); LLM cap raised to $3.50; T3 t0 agreement 53%. See README.md, results/*.json and figures/.

  title: Where new scientific concepts spread next
  summary: >-
    Full-corpus OpenAlex snapshot experiment (476M works, 0 API credits for data) on how 653 newborn concepts (legacy-concept
    lexicon, tag-AND-title grounding; benchmark precision 0.996, LLM+hand labelled, $0.007) enter new venue fields, using
    the frozen iteration-1 26-field PMI backbone. Dev = CS/Eng/BGM/Med homes, t0 2003-09 (274 concepts); held-out = other
    fields + 2010-14 cohort (369), run ONCE after a hashed freeze. H2 ENTRY (conditional logit on concept-year risk sets):
    relatedness to the off-home fields that currently RETAIN the concept predicts the next field entered beyond size, Hidalgo
    density, relatedness-to-home and own centrality: held-out LR 71.7 (p=2e-17), d=0.30 [0.24,0.37], positive in Physical/LifeEnv/Social/Cohort,
    DL pooled 0.28 [0.22,0.35] I2=0, label-permutation p=0.001, rewired-backbone p=0.015 -> CONFIRMED by the frozen rule.
    BUT the gateway WEIGHTING adds nothing beyond plain retaining relatedness (M3 vs M1 g-only permutation p=0.17 held-out,
    0.31 dev); target-field size is the strongest single block (AUC 0.76 vs density 0.59); incremental AUC only 0.809->0.817.
    ORDERING: first retained gateway field precedes the calibrated entropy take-off in 66% of broad concepts (sign p=0.003)
    vs 57% for peripheral fields (McNemar p=0.09) -> confirmed by rule, but the lead-lag gateway-permutation placebo (p=0.63)
    says the panel does not single out gateway fields. RESCUE (background-adjusted citation provenance, shared-author links
    removed; Hanski connectivity) and RELAY (availability-null) NOT supported on held-out; the iteration-1 gateway-retention
    lead did NOT replicate (coef ~0). TRAJECTORIES: DTW k-medoids k=2 stable (bootstrap ARI 1.0): volume-matched 'integrating'
    vs 'localized' classes (held-out independent recluster ARI 0.54; localized class dominated by Medicine homes). Independent
    audits: R1, p_gw and held-out AUCs reproduced exactly; exact-likelihood clogit gives LR 77.3, DL-pooled d 0.32 [0.25,0.39]
    (Breslow pipeline is conservative); within-stratum shuffled labels reject 0/20; random-year ordering placebo 0.43 << 0.66.
    Outputs: method_out.json (entry_events_dev/heldout with predict_M0 vs predict_M2 within-stratum probabilities; retention_episodes),

  title: Does the gateway-field retention signal replicate?
  summary: >-
    Zero-API stress test of iteration-1's only live lead: the adopting field's gateway (eigenvector) centrality on the 1998-2002
    26-field PMI backbone (gateway_j) adding +0.103 AUC for field retention R (exp4, 80 episodes). Pre-registered verdict:
    FAILS. Reproduction: exp4's 0.10254 / 0.10222 reproduce exactly. Block A (LOGO logistic, concept-clustered REFIT bootstrap):
    delta-AUC over M2 (own field baseline + B5 + log field size + phi_home + density) is exp4 +0.037 [95% CI -0.018, 0.130],
    exp1 (s2-fos crosswalk, 367 rows) +0.001, exp3 (129) -0.006, union panel (362 de-duplicated episodes, 54 concepts) +0.001
    [-0.012, 0.012], new-episodes-only panel (282) -0.001 [-0.021, 0.017]; the DL pooled value is +0.0015 (I2=0, descriptive).
    exp4's own M0 lead keeps a refit CI of [0.010, 0.212], but the multi-feature iteration-1 rows lose significance. B1: gateway
    adds +0.0015 over M2 + leave-concept-out field propensity P (union). B2: gateway explains 50% of exp4 field intercepts
    (p=0.14, 10 fields) and removes 74% of the field variance there, but R2=0.03 (p=0.55) and 2.5% on the union panel. B3:
    the time-varying backbone validates (rho 0.92) but is NOT IDENTIFIABLE (within/between SD 0.023). C2 node-label permutation:
    the union real value is at the 54th percentile; C1 rewiring discriminates (median rho 0.32): exp4 M0 at p=0.01, union
    not significant; no rival centrality (strength, degree, betweenness, PageRank, closeness, k-core, phi_min eigenvector,
    size) survives Holm correction. D: all 8 G-variant O1 gains (+0.05..+0.15) are label-coverage ARTEFACTS (G +0.072 -> +0.002).
    E: concept ICC 0.135; with a field random intercept the SD of delta-AUC under the alternative stays at ~0.015 whatever
    N is (1k-4k), an MDE floor of ~0.02 from having only 26 fields; ~34 held-out concepts per group give P(group delta>0)>=0.9
    at a true delta of 0.05. F: corrected record tables (rho_B5, A*_h, exp3 portability, exp4 secondary screens, F5 refit
    CIs). Reusable output: results/union_episodes.csv (harmonised union panel). An independent audit (own solver) re-derives
    the headline deltas; a shuffled-R placebo on exp4's 80 rows gives a 95th percentile of 0.130, above 0.103, so the original
    lead cannot be certified on 80 episodes. All tables are in eval_out.json metadata; the flat headline numbers are in metrics_agg.

  title: When research concepts were officially recognised
  summary: |-
    External-recognition lookup table (outcome O5) for all 65,026 OpenAlex legacy concepts (64,723 target concepts at levels 2-5), built with zero OpenAlex credits and $1.49 of OpenRouter calls. Every event is dated and sourced, and carries year_usable, match_method, match_confidence and relation (same/narrower/broader, stated from the external entry's side). Present-day facts sit in a separate present_day block (year_known=false). sources_checked records found / not_found / not_applicable for each concept and source. There are no O5 flags and no t0 lags; the panel builder derives those.

    Sources: MeSH 2026 (20,872 concepts; DateIntroduced year; mesh_baseline flags years <=1966); English Wikipedia creation dates (6,540 exact first revisions with redirect-first repair; all other titles have a page-id estimate, 93% same calendar year in CV, and year_usable only for years that calibrate well); Wikidata P571/P575 (1,425 concepts); ACM CCS 1998/2012, MSC 2000/2010/2020 and PACS 2010/PhySH (taxonomy_in_version and taxonomy_added_between events); Nature Methods MoTY, Science BOTY, Physics World BOTY 2009-2025, MIT TR10, Gartner Hype Cycle 1995-2025 and Clarivate/CAS Research Fronts 2017-2025 (589 concepts); JEL as present-day membership only.

    Datasets (full_data_out/ parts): concept_recognition (65,026), external_entries_{mesh 31,830, acm_ccs 3,583, msc 17,872, pacs_physh 8,462, jel 1,015, curated_lists 2,666}, match_verifications (28,914 LLM judgements), crosswalk_level1_to_field (284) and spotcheck_p78 (78; 86% of the iteration-1 P78 concepts join). metadata_fold is a provisional dev/heldout/unassigned split from level-1 ancestors mapped to the OpenAlex fields and then to the hypothesis groups. It holds 19.6k/28.3k/17.1k concepts, and plurality group and share are included so the panel can apply S1's rule.

    Quality: all known-answer asserts pass (optogenetics NM 2010, iPSC NM 2009, CRISPR BOTY 2015, super-resolution NM 2008). Audit precision is 0.96 for label matches, 0.79 for ID links and 0.31 for alias-only matches, so alias matches were LLM-verified. Accepted LLM links are 0.97 precise on hand check. relation=same is reliable except for Research Fronts; narrower vs broader is only indicative. Inter-model kappa is 0.60 (accept/reject). Caveats: coverage is uneven (Social and Eng have no dated domain taxonomy, so use a Wikipedia/Wikidata-only O5 variant across groups), Wikipedia dates cluster in its 2001-2007 growth wave, and Research Fronts are citation-derived. See README.md, out/coverage_report.json and out/sources.json.

  title: How our results compare with related papers
  summary: |-
    Positioning study for the Applied Network Science (ANS) paper on emerging concepts. Deliverables: research_report.md (sections A-F) and raw evidence in raw/.
    (1) Collection: 'Networks for everyday life' cannot be read by any route (Springer IdP/JS, no Wayback snapshot). Only the scope text was recovered (societal domains: health, mobility, education, politics; rolling). The member list, editors and deadline are unknown, so do not claim topic overlap; argue fit through foresight/funding relevance and ANS method overlap.
    (2) 22 citable ANS papers with a 'how we relate' line each. The core set: Fontaine 2024 (AI into neuroscience), De Domenico 2016 (disciplines as sources/sinks), Holmgren 2023 (alluvial change), Gao 2018, Cunningham 2022, Larson 2017, Renoust 2017 (ANS 2:23). Plus about 40 neighbour-journal and preprint works.
    (3) Comparison numbers:
    - Guevara 2016 field-entry AUC: individuals 0.896, organisations 0.715, countries 0.682. Entry only, no exit. Our density AUC 0.61 < log-size 0.74: report density's increment over size.
    - Exit and survival evidence (Neffke 2011, Rigby 2015, Goya 2019) is regression-based and credits relatedness. No published retention AUC exists, so our +0.10 delta-AUC (0.705 -> 0.808, base rate 0.56) is an increment without a direct counterpart.
    - Link-forecast AUCs of 0.95-0.97 (Maillart 2606.03864; Gu & Krenn >0.9; Krenn positives about 1-3%) are level AUCs and not comparable.
    - Maillart 2606.03919 R2 0.60-0.87 are within-domain replications, not cross-field transfer.
    - Weng 2013: about 7x the precision of random guessing from the first 50 tweets (H3 precedent).
    (4) Novelty: adopter-centrality retention is NEW for concept adoption by fields but partially anticipated in general (Hidalgo 2007 position -> faster diversification; Yenilmez 2026 centrality explains diversification). The rescue/metapopulation analogy is partially anticipated in cultural evolution (Premo & Kuhn 2010; Premo 2012; Hopkinson 2011). Relay is partially anticipated (Weng 2013; Cheng 2023; Leydesdorff betweenness). Frame H1 as the first test in science, not a new principle. RISK: reviewers will want the adopter-portfolio relatedness-density rival.
    (5) ANS template, inferred from 8 articles from 2024-2026: unstructured abstract of 165-297 words; keywords optional; Introduction/Methods/Results/Discussion/Conclusions; back matter; author-year citations; 1-12 figures. Model wording for data availability and competing interests is included.
    (6) About 95 references verified; 12 corrections (Centola/Weng for complex contagion; Hidalgo/Neffke/Guevara for relatedness; Maillart authorship; Cunningham & Greene in PLoS ONE; wrong DOIs for Pinheiro, Yan, Kiss and Bettencourt fixed).

  title: Do concepts spread from fields that keep them?
  summary: |-
    Decisive zero-credit test of the retained-frontier claim (EXP6 lead: a concept next enters fields related to the off-home fields that currently RETAIN it, d0_ret_rel) against the field-standard relatedness-density rival built as the literature builds it (omega = sum U phi / sum phi with U = RCA>1: annual Hidalgo current portfolio [primary], 3-year, Guevara-2016 cumulative and persistence-filtered), plus share-weighted density (D_vol, D_vol_w3, D_cum), and of the abandonment penalty (d_lost: relatedness to dropped off-home presences). Conditional logit (Breslow) on concept x target-field x year entry risk sets, concept-year strata, frozen 1998-2002 26-field PMI backbone; nested ladder R0 (home relatedness, log size, entered density, own gateway) -> R1 +D_rca_1y -> R2 +D_vol -> R3 +d0 -> R4 +d_lost; S_strict = all 4 RCA + both D_vol; S_pca; A1 = R0 + d_lost.

    STEP 1 (EXP6 frame, robustness): risk sets rebuilt row-for-row (max diff 4e-16) and EXP6 held-out M1 vs M0 LR 68.57 / d0 0.2809 reproduced; d0 survives RCA>1 and volume: R3 0.262 [0.196,0.320], S_strict 0.252 [0.188,0.315], permutation p=0.001.

    STEP 2 (independent frame: EXP5 12,499 concepts minus every EXP6 concept by OpenAlex ID/QID/normalised label -> 11,841; DEV 4,486 used for code, standardisation, power and rules; hash-frozen, git 24da538; held-out scored ONCE). Held-out pooled PHYS+LIFEENV+SOC+MATHDEC (3,162 concepts, 6,978 entries): LR(R3 vs R2)=325.8, d0=0.322 [0.291,0.355] (concept refit bootstrap 1,000), S_strict 0.304 [0.268,0.336], crossed concept x field CI [0.201,0.468]; positive in PHYS 0.15, LIFEENV 0.40, SOC 0.30 (MATHDEC 0.07, underpowered, excluded pre-freeze), cohort 2010-14 0.321 [0.292,0.347]; DL 4 groups 0.243 [0.118,0.368], I2=0.92. Retained-label permutation p=0.001, rewire p=0.004, node-label p=0.003; dose by persistence age 2/3/>=4 = 0.10/0.08/0.30 (4+ minus 2: 0.21 [0.16,0.26]); stable under target-field FE (0.30), RCA-defined entry event (0.24), primary-topic fields, min_n 3/5, horizon 8, exclusions. BUT the pre-declared volume-matched contrast (retained vs entered-not-retained fields in the same current x cumulative volume cell) is null: -0.028 [-0.105,0.046] (fine bins -0.026), so frozen verdict FRONTIER = PARTIAL ('persistence confounded with volume'). Also: under a Hidalgo min-conditional-probability proximity d0 vanishes (-0.021, p=0.012) - backbone-specific; the econ-geo LPM row gives d0 slightly negative, and an EXPLORATORY diagnostic shows it is ~0 once size enters non-linearly (relative-odds, not additive-probability, effect). ABANDONMENT: d_lost in A1 = -0.007 [-0.036,0.022] (power 0.99 at -0.06) -> INCONCLUSIVE/no penalty; with d0 it turns positive (+0.064). Within-stratum AUC R2 0.847 -> R3 0.852; Guevara-comparable global AUC of D_rca_cum 0.635 (flagged, different unit/event).

    Checks: 10 unit tests pass; planted d0=0.2 detected 100%, null rejection 0/200; shuffled entries 0/20; independent audit (hand Breslow exact reproduction; statsmodels EXACT likelihood LR ratio 0.99-1.02; 20 rows re-derived from raw counts; inline DL) all pass. Outputs: results/frontier_result.json (all numbers), step1/step2 JSONs, frozen_spec + seal/unseal logs, risk-set and state-panel parquets, null draws, 6 figures (forest d0 / d_lost by unit, ladder, dose, null histograms, volume-matched), method_out.json = full_method_out.json (252,922 held-out candidate rows with predict_R2_rca_vol_baseline vs predict_R3_retained_frontier from frozen DEV coefficients).

  title: Which early network signals of new topics travel
  summary: >-
    RQ1 held-out deliverable on the EXP5 frame (12,499 TAG-grounded OpenAlex concepts; DEV CS/Eng/BGM/Med 4,771; held-out
    PHYS 742, LIFEENV 1,113, SOC 1,352, MATHDEC 165; 2010-14 cohort 2,484 DEV-home + 1,872 other). Two zero-credit OpenAlex
    S3 passes (Pass A reproduces EXP5 grounded counts exactly for all concepts; Pass B windowed citations). 53 indicators
    in 7 families over t0..t0+2 (popularity E, disciplinary F, landing G, retained-frontier FR, 27 co-occurrence ego-network
    A ported from EXP3 and validated to 1e-15, co-author S) plus B5 baseline. Outcomes: O1c/O1b uptake, O2r_m50/O2r_resid
    breadth, O3 transience, O4 field/year-normalised citation growth, O5/O5_WW external recognition (art_O7Dq4L02QnDN). DEV-only
    ranking (psp|B5, LOGO dAUC, refit bootstraps), frozen top-10s + ElasticNet/L1-logit + EBM, hash seal, single unseal, DL
    pooling, Holm. RESULTS: breadth is predictable beyond B5 and portable: 7/10 (O2r_m50) and 8/10 (O2r_resid) frozen indicators
    confirmed with 6/6 unit sign agreement; M0_density_end psp +0.377 [0.280,0.466], D_vol_end +0.307, CONTACT_REACH +0.210,

    cumulative 1995..t0+2 field history, i.e. partly a pre-onset footprint). O1c: only n_authors_early (+0.161). O4: REL_home
    -0.114, author_growth +0.065; EBM Spearman 0.188 vs B5 0.015. O5/O5_WW: no indicator or model beats B5+onset year. Learned:
    breadth ElasticNet 0.765 vs B5 0.706 (+0.059 [0.046,0.073]). Pre-registered: P2 holds; P1,P3,P4,P5 fail. Robust to EXP6-overlap
    exclusion, coverage covariates, O2r_m30, EXP5 O2r_resid definition. Audits: T0-T8 pass; independent audit.py and rederive.py

  title: Auditing the record before the paper
  summary: >-
    Zero-new-data audit of the iteration-2 record (eval_out.json, exp_eval_sol_out, validated). WP1 claims_ledger.csv: 246
    rows read by key path (224 MATCH, 15 MISLABELLED, 6 MISMATCH, 1 FILE_FLAG_OVERRIDDEN; 58 blocking). H1: lpm_beta_within_gt0_p05
    = true (beta +0.068/SD, concept-clustered p 0.041, two-way p 0.17; sealed code uses p_concept), verdict still DISCONFIRMED.
    Ordering -> MIXED: 57/87 non-tied = 65.5%, but 57/102 evaluable and 57/175 = 32.6% of broad concepts; lead-lag negative,
    pre-trend ev-3 -0.072 (p 0.0002), DEV reverse b 0.232 (p 0.006). H3: pooled CI [-0.006, 0.065] includes 0; DEV 0.138 ->
    shrinkage 0.21; 0/40 is a false-positive rate. Dataset-2 counts 3,583/17,872/8,462/1,015 are ENTRIES (concepts 1,298/1,121/2,635/213).
    The 'B5+all_four' row is size_controlled_all_three (+0.085, refit CI [-0.043, 0.220]). MDE 0.004 is the 90% point for
    8,515 episodes. WP2: record_tables/ has the 34-indicator portability table, exp1 lineage robustness, 12 partial associations,
    H1 criteria, ordering, coverage_iter2 and refit bootstrap CIs (B=2000; all 7 iteration-1 deltas reproduce exactly; none
    of the CIs excludes 0; 1.2-2.2x wider than fixed CIs). T4 next_field_trace.json reproduces all 26 Exp6 headline numbers:
    LR 68.6 = M1 vs M0 Breslow, 71.7 = M2 vs M0 Breslow, 77.3 = M2 exact (M1 exact 73.2); 961 = informative strata, 2,339
    = all primary strata; d 0.281 = M1, 0.302 = M2. The per-row parquet is in record_tables/. WP3 frame_agreement.json (628
    shared concepts): onset exact 0.976, home kappa 0.99, O2r_m50 rho 0.998, episode Jaccard median 1.0, but retention kappa
    0.28 (0.98 with the matched absolute R_abs2 rule) -> pooling PARTIAL. An Exp5-minus-Exp6 H2 confirmation must rebuild
    RETAINED/LOST with R_cj. Concepts left: PHYS 708, LIFEENV 1,081, SOC 1,301, MATHDEC 165, COHORT 4,117. WP4 o5_validation.json:
    O5_main held-out base rate 0.238, UNRELATED to publication outcomes (pooled rho O2r_m50 0.014 [-0.045, 0.073], O1 0.001).
    67% of concepts are recognised at or before t0. Executor-checked 100-item hand check: precision 0.86, dates within 1 year
    95%, false-negative rate >= 0.14, FIT_FOR_USE true, but only 42% of positives mark a genuinely new concept. LLM spend
    $0.009. text_corrections.md gives the old and new sentences with source keys. verify_headlines.py re-derives the headline
    numbers independently, with placebos.

  title: Is 'fields that keep it' new? Prior art and venue check
  summary: |-
    Prior-art, comparison and venue positioning for the iteration-3 ANS paper. It builds on art_dxvRpQufMR0e.

    (1) CLAIM A (next-field entry follows relatedness to fields that RETAIN a concept): PARTIALLY ANTICIPATED.
    - Persistence is used only as a filter on the entry OUTCOME: Pinheiro et al. 2022 (Δ=4 backward/forward RCA rule), Albora et al. 2023 (RCA<0.25 in all prior years), Bahar et al. 2014 (jumps).
    - All densities found are current-snapshot (RCA>1 or continuous).
    - No retained-only or duration-weighted density predictor was found in 6 strands.
    - Cheng et al. 2023 ("consistent intellectual usage" → core concept) is the closest science analogue; it is global, not per field.

    (2) CLAIM B (relatedness to fields that DROPPED it lowers entry): mechanism partly anticipated; NEW as a test.
    - Mechanism precedents: Fernandes & Tang 2014 (negative neighbour signals deter entry; empirically, neighbours' export growth); Nomaler & Verspagen 2022 (absence/loss informative, adds little).
    - No study uses neighbours' exits as entry predictors.
    - Our Exp6 estimate is fragile: d_lost −0.063, p 0.055.

    (3) RIVALS FOR THE EXPERIMENT
    - MISSING: persistence-filtered RCA density D_rca_persist_k; own pre-entry RCA level/trend (Albora benchmark); neighbour-momentum density.
    - PARTLY COVERED: a β_ret = β_lost test within D_ever.

    (4) RQ1 TABLE R1
    - No comparator uses held-out fields.
    - Link-forecast AUCs (Krenn 0.85 with ~5% positives; 0.95-0.97) are level metrics and not comparable to our increments over B5.

    (5) RQ2 TABLE R2
    - Prior work has field-pair modes (Sun & Latora, 4) and source/sink indices.
    - No contact × retention decomposition and no per-field entered/retained/lost tracking was found: NEW.
    - Entity-entry AUROC comparators: 0.879/0.856/0.631 (Galuppo Azevedo 2021).

    (6) VENUE
    - The collection page is IdP-blocked by every route.
    - Snippets give: submissions open 24 Jun 2026, deadline 30 Nov 2026, scope items on information diffusion and innovation/collaboration/knowledge-exchange networks.
    - Editors and member articles are unrecovered.

    (7) ANS SKELETON AND FIG. 1
    - Skeleton from 3 sci-sci ANS articles (Cunningham 2022 published; Fontaine 2024 and Holmgren 2023 on arXiv), plus a 5-lane Fig. 1 spec with this run's counts and a caption draft.

    (8) REFERENCES AND FILES

  title: Do open-neighbourhood concepts spread? Fresh-cohort test
  summary: >-
    Single-unseal confirmation of the RQ1 openness claim from EXP8, on a fresh 2015-2017 onset cohort of OpenAlex legacy concepts
    that no earlier screen had touched. One zero-credit S3 pass covered the snapshot of 2026-09-23 (identical to EXP5; checks
    T1-T3 exact). The outcome-blind S3 audit kept TAG grounding: legacy tags still cover 2021-24, with the control ratio at
    a minimum of 0.902. The LLM precision gate passed 94% of candidates, leaving 1,070 concepts with 2015-16 onsets. Pre-seal
    power was 0.16, so the declared 2017 extension applied (n = 1,443; 634 with O2r_m50; 573 with OPEN_home). OPEN is the
    mean of six signed, z-scored ego-network components, with constants frozen on the 12,499 EXP5 concepts; it was built ALL
    / HOME-ONLY / SIZE-MATCHED. The ladder runs R0 = B5 + onset year, then adds contact reach, LLM concept type, pre-onset
    footprint, coverage and group FE. The spec was hash-sealed before the unseal. RESULT: the frozen verdict is CONFIRMED
    but marginal. OPEN_home partial Spearman with O2r_m50 is +0.091 [+0.013, +0.171] at R2 and +0.080 [+0.001, +0.162] at
    R3. The CIs include 0 at R4/R5, the DL pool over groups is +0.083 [-0.007, +0.173], and Holm p = 0.048. It adds no practical
    prediction (B5 Spearman 0.768 vs 0.770). Mechanical coupling is large: OPEN_all +0.174, ALL minus HOME +0.093 [+0.016,
    +0.169], with size-matched in between. Home-only signal comes from NOV_res (+0.134) and low edge persistence (-0.112),
    not from the community count. Type and footprint do not absorb OPEN. Replications: CONTACT_REACH (+0.211), n_authors_early
    on O1c (+0.115), RETENTION_RATIO_early < 0 at R0 only; the EXP8 ElasticNet beats B5 by +0.030. The type gate failed twice,
    so the declared M1 = M2 fallback was used. O4 was not run. Independent re-derivations (audit.py, rederive.py) reproduce
    psp exactly; the shuffled and random-OPEN placebos are null. LLM spend $2.04. Deliverables: results/cohort_report.json,
    cohort_result.json, exp5_selection_result.json, figures/, full_method_out.json (predict_B5 vs predict_B5_plus_OPEN_home
    per concept).

  title: 'How concepts spread: early reach vs keeping fields'
  summary: >-
    Cache-only re-run of the RQ2 trajectories analysis on all 12,499 EXP5 frame concepts (DEV 4,771 CS/Eng/BGM/Med; held-out
    PHYS/LIFEENV/SOC/MATHDEC 3,372; 2010-14 cohort 4,356). Held-out outcomes were previously unsealed by EXP5/EXP7/EXP8, so
    held-out results are within-frame robustness checks; this artifact's choices were hash-sealed on DEV (results/frozen_spec.json)
    before it read held-out data. (1) Exact decomposition of the top-vs-bottom O2r_resid tercile gap in retained off-home
    breadth at t0+8: log Bn = log E2 (early contact, fields entered by t0+2) + log M (frontier advance) + log rho (retention),
    volume-stratified. PR1 SUPPORTED everywhere: s_explore - s_ret (Medicine excluded) DEV 0.633 [0.537,0.727], held-out pooled
    0.492 [0.403,0.575], cohort 0.445 [0.358,0.527], DL 0.504 [0.329,0.679] (I2 0.76). Shares DEV 0.79/0.03/0.18 (E2/M/rho).
    Frontier advance M ~0; D_rho positive (integrating concepts keep a larger share). Robust to min_n 3/5, O2r_m50, O1b-only,
    onset-restricted counts, Das Gupta and concept-level covariance decompositions. (2) PR2 (localised keep more early) FAILS
    raw (DEV reversed -0.110, held-out null +0.011, cohort reversed); only the partial clause holds (partial Spearman of early
    retention ratio with O2r_resid given B5: -0.169/-0.129/-0.173; replicates EXP8). (3) No trajectory typology passes the
    naming rule (DTW k=4 vs HMM S=5 ARI 0.222; Hennig Jaccard 0.69-0.82; no-Med ARI 0.46; held-out re-cluster ARI 0.44/0.38)
    -> CONTINUUM: PC1 38.8% breadth-of-spread axis, PC2 10.7% keep-vs-lose axis. (4) Early ego-network openness (OPEN; 3 builds
    ALL/HOME-ONLY/SIZE-MATCHED) correlates with PC1 beyond B5+label coverage: DEV partial 0.174/0.117/0.135, held-out DL 0.120/0.060/0.094
    (I2 0), not with the keeping axis. (5) Sequence test: no ordering signal beyond the mechanical lag (excess <=1.7pp, sign
    flips); intersection-born concepts take off off-home later (HR ~0.45). (6) 7 most-similar case pairs (7/7 high-OPEN broader,
    illustration) and a 37-concept retrospective AI/CS atlas. Verification: D3 states equal EXP7 on 5.56M cells; ego code
    reproduces EXP8 exactly; T0 unit tests pass; independent re-derivation of all headline numbers <=1e-16; placebos fail.

    independent verify_ledger.py agrees on every row (9 orphan tokens, all section/line numbers). PART B (sealed spec, old

    M0_density_end 0.374 -> 0.187 post-onset (attenuation 0.50 [0.38,0.60]); D_vol_end 0.317 -> 0.176 (0.45); post-onset D_vol
    is nearly rank-identical to B5 reach (rho 0.97-1.00). B2: OPEN pooled psp +0.181 [0.082,0.277] (DL4, O2r_m50), 6/6 units
    positive, prediction interval includes 0. B3: 1,920-spec curve: 99.7% of pooled CIs > 0, all estimates > 0, median 0.152,
    Freedman-Lane p=0.005; contact-reach control barely moves it (0.146 vs 0.158). B4: 21 sub-units lower I2 to 0.43; no trait
    moderates; LIFEENV weakness UNEXPLAINED (not coverage, not range restriction) = domain boundary. Step 3: Exp7 D_rca_pers
    differs from Research 2 D_rca_persist_k (max rho 0.877), so that rival remains untested. audit_headlines.py re-derives

  title: Is 'keep exploring, spread widest' already known?
  summary: |-
    Novelty and positioning report (iteration 4) for the Exp8 openness-vs-consolidation claim, for the Applied Network Science paper. It builds on art_EesdB8cuSfcU and art_dxvRpQufMR0e without redoing their work. Files: research_report.md (Sections A-I), reproducibility.md, raw/ (query log, fetched page extracts, verify.json).

    VERDICTS
    - C1, openness → later cross-field breadth: PARTIALLY ANTICIPATED. The same direction is shown for concept pairs (Maillart 2026: test R² 0.69 entropy / 0.78 exogenous, random 80/20 split), papers (Wang 2017: odds of top-1% citation in foreign fields +62.37%), memes (Weng 2013) and people (Ugander 2012). Concept-level evidence exists only for volume (Cheng 2023) or transfer to patents (Cao 2020). No study found combines the concept unit, a size-adjusted breadth outcome and held-out fields.
    - C2, consolidation → less breadth: PARTIALLY ANTICIPATED in mechanism (Palla 2007 large-group turnover; Ugander; Weng; Burt) and CONTRADICTED-BY on other outcomes:
      - Cheng et al. 2023 ASR, full text read: "ideational consistency" = cosine of neighbour co-usage t−1→t, i.e. weighted edge persistence. +53% next-year articles per SD (b = .43); embeddedness +25%; author co-author density −15%. The DV is volume at t+1, with no current-volume control and in-sample. The authors state they do not study cross-domain translation.
      - Chavalarias & Cointet 2013: dense term-clusters survive; density rises during emergence and falls before decline.
      - Centola 2010 and Romero 2011: clustering helps adoption.
      - Salatino 2017: density among parent topics precedes birth.
      Recommended framing: an outcome-dependent reversal (consistency → depth/survival, churn → reach).
    - C3, a low retention ratio of contacted fields: NEW (analogues only: propagule/colonisation pressure; Palla; Cheng's social consistency b = .02).
    - C4, within-concept closure → entry slowdown: NEW as a lead-lag test. The field-level prior is opposite (Chavalarias). Life-cycle analogues: Singh 2022, Prabhakaran 2016.

    WHAT THE REPORT PROVIDES
    - An our-numbers card (Exp8 held-out psp|B5 with CIs and I²).
    - Strand-by-strand extraction rows for S1-S9.
    - A Cheng operationalisation box with the reconciling sentence.
    - T-RQ1: ours vs Maillart, Cheng, Cao, Wang, Weng, Ugander, Salatino, Chen, Kong. Level AUCs (Krenn 0.85; 0.954-0.967) are marked not comparable.
    - T-RQ2: 12 trajectory/sequence comparators; our contact × retention decomposition and FE event study have no counterpart.
    - 8 ANS papers with relation lines.
    - An 8-lane Fig. 1 spec with {pipeline_counts.json:KEY} slots and a caption.
    - A 14-row reviewer-threat table.
    - 68 newly verified references, 66/67 identifiers resolved via Crossref/arXiv, plus 12 carried.

    CORRECTIONS AND DESIGN GAPS
    - Corrected DOIs: Chen 2012 = 10.1002/asi.21694 (not asi.22662); Moser & Nicholas = 10.1257/0002828041301407; Feldman & Yoon = 10.1093/icc/dtr040.
    - UNVERIFIED (do not cite): Van Noorden 2014, Shinn & Joerges 2002, Fujimura 1992, arXiv 2209.03687 / 2408.06839 / 2606.25320.
    - DESIGN GAPS for the experiments:
      1. ego_density_W3 is not degree-normalised (Ravasz & Barabási C(k) ~ 1/k); add a configuration-null z-score.
      2. Run Cheng's exact consistency/embeddedness measures on volume vs breadth; the predicted result is a sign flip.
      3. Report survival alongside breadth and test the size × turnover interaction (Palla).
      4. Concept-type tagging with within-type tests; no prior effect size exists.
      5. Heterogeneity-robust staggered event-study estimators for C4.

    vocabulary-free population, Frame N: newborn title noun phrases (onsets 2003-2015) that are absent from the 56,643 legacy
    OpenAlex/MAG concepts and the 65,026 art_O7Dq4L02QnDN labels. It used zero OpenAlex credits: two passes over the 2026-09-23
    S3 snapshot. Pass M took a 20% file sample and yielded 407k n-gram keys, 132,077 candidates at k_t=4 after exclusions
    and POS. Pass N covered all 2,040 files, 1995-2022, with 24.2M verified hits; outcome rows were sealed at write time.
    Base totals equal EXP10 exactly. The masked onset rule gave 4,468 onsets. After dedup and home, 2,257 phrases went to
    the LLM gates; M1 kept 1,137 and the categorical G2 gate kept 636 concepts. Declared deviations: one outcome-blind re-mine
    (v1 bursts, recall 6% < 15%) and G2, adopted after the boolean gate failed the blind checks (keep-precision 0.37 and 0.43;
    G2 0.63 on the dev set). Fallback E added the 2015 onsets. Fallback A switched the primary outcome to O2r_m30 (397 < 800
    concepts with O2r_m50). Pre-unseal power at psp 0.08 was 0.47. FROZEN VERDICT: PARTIAL. OPEN_home psp is +0.117 [+0.020,
    +0.218] at R3 and +0.086 [-0.009, +0.190] at R5. On O2r_m50 it is +0.161 and +0.122, with both CIs > 0. NOVCHURN_home
    at R3 is +0.108 [+0.007, +0.211]. 3 of 4 estimable groups are positive (SOC -0.025); DL is +0.112 [-0.015, +0.239]; Holm
    p is 0.052. NOV_res_home carries the signal (+0.208); edge persistence is null. Coupling (ALL-HOME +0.056) is not significant.
    Cheng consistency predicts next-year volume (rho +0.42, surviving size control) but is -0.064 with breadth (CI includes
    0), so the reversal is not confirmed. Embeddedness is -0.250 with breadth. The clean variants agree (rarefied NOVCHURN
    +0.150). There is no forecasting gain over B5 (Spearman 0.80). Versus legacy newborns, Frame-N concepts are 14% narrower,
    89% more transient and 26% less sustained. Exploratory results: the strict-gate subset gives R5 +0.106 [+0.004, +0.217],
    and pooling with EXP10 gives R3 +0.096 [+0.034, +0.158]. The audit reproduces the headline numbers to within 1e-9. LLM
    spend: $0.92.

  title: 'Cheng''s consistency: size effect, not reach'
  summary: >-
    Rebuilds Cheng et al. (2023, ASR) 'ideational consistency' (cosine of a concept's topic co-usage vector t-1 -> t), a PMI
    embeddedness analogue and co-author tie density for 12,499 EXP5 frame concepts (t0..t0+10) and the 1,443-concept 2015-17
    EXP10 cohort, from cached grounded OpenAlex rows ($0, 0 credits). Spec and verdict rules sealed before fitting (git commit
    1). TEST A (Cheng design, 105,839 concept-years): NB twin reproduces Cheng almost exactly (b=0.428, +53.5%/SD vs Cheng
    .43/+53%); PPML +83% [+71,+97]; adding log V(t) leaves +1.3% [+0.5,+2.1]; A2/A1 ratio 0.021 [0.009,0.035] (500-draw concept-cluster
    bootstrap) -> SIZE-DOMINATED; concept FE +1.4%. TEST B (early trait, psp | B5 + dummies, 2,000 draws): raw Spearman with
    V(t0+3) +0.256 [0.239,0.274] but psp with rarefied cross-field reach O2r_m50 -0.069 [-0.093,-0.047] (DL over 5 groups
    -0.079, I2=0, 5/5 negative), O2r_resid -0.077; replicated on 2015-17 cohort -0.111 [-0.197,-0.030], n=615 (R3 rung -0.098).
    Depth outcomes null (O1c -0.000, O1b -0.004, O3 -0.001); paired diff O1c-O2r_m50 +0.035 [0.004,0.066] (DL CI incl. 0).
    Frozen verdict: REVERSAL CONFIRMED (on selection data), REVERSAL REPLICATED, SIZE-DOMINATED, DEPTH-REACH SPLIT (the split
    is null-depth vs negative-reach). TEST C (within concept, ci+year FE): consistent years followed by slightly MORE off-home
    entries (b=+0.025, boot CI [0.004,0.048]) -> P6 fails; reach penalty is a between-concept trait. TEST D: no Palla size
    x consistency interaction. TEST E: ALL-papers build more negative for reach (diff -0.032). Identity: Spearman 0.77 with
    Exp11 Jaccard persistence, 0.34 with log early volume. Adding CONS to a DEV-fitted B5 rank model does not improve held-out
    prediction (delta ~0). All bodies are selection data (outcomes previously read), not confirmation. Independent re-derivation
    (rederive.py: statsmodels GLM full panel, QR psp from raw inputs) matches all headline numbers except C1 (not re-derived);
    placebos fail. Key files: results/cheng_verdict.json, cheng_panel_models.json, cheng_static.json, panel_C.json, palla.json,

  title: Why churning concepts spread; Exp11 test completed
  summary: >-
    Cache-only, $0-LLM iteration-5 experiment with three parts. (C) Completion of the sealed Exp11 within-concept closure
    test from its sealed code, with a path-only patch and single BLAS threads (the fix for the Exp11 crash). Gates pass: G0
    21/21 sealed hashes, the rebuilt panel equals the cache, G1 DEV reproduces exactly, and all 8 Exp11 unit tests pass. DEV
    verdict unchanged: NOT SUPPORTED. OLD_HELDOUT PPML: density +0.068 [-0.072,+0.209]; OPEN_home -0.079 [-0.146,-0.013],
    the opposite of the predicted sign. COHORT 2010-14: both null. H-M5 fails; H-M3 is null in all bodies. Sun-Abraham event
    study, DEV never-treated: lag 0..2 = -0.018 [-0.042,+0.004], pre-trend p 0.52, Roth detectable slope 0.022, event-date
    placebo p 0.19; held-out and cohort null. H-M4 fails. Home volume itself drops at the closure jump (-0.022, CI<0), so
    the jumps are partly mechanical. H-S1 holds on DEV (+0.113), COHORT (+0.105) and pooled (+0.076 [+0.024,+0.126]) but not
    on OLD_HELDOUT (+0.001). Pooled off-home entries fall after the home-prominence peak (-0.030 [-0.047,-0.016]). H-P1 as
    preregistered fails: the community half is +0.216 [+0.081,+0.351], the METHOD half -0.055. (A, EXPLORATORY, spec hash-sealed
    before the outcome join) The HOME new, dropped and added partner sets are rebuilt with the EXP8 primitives (G2 reproduces
    Exp10 exactly). Each partner is classified by METHOD/DOMAIN type, new/same community, degree under the null and mixed/pure
    carrier, giving an exact additive decomposition of NOV_res, new_edge_rate and churn. Parts are scored by partial Spearman
    given B5 with 2,000 concept bootstraps and DL over held-out groups, plus Shapley games, Holm over 5 contrasts and two
    label placebos. NOVCHURN_home replicates: POOLED +0.118, held-out DL +0.097 (I2 0), 2015-17 cohort +0.171/+0.144 at R0/R3.
    The signal comes from new-community partners (C2 +0.102, Holm p .0025; cohort +0.18) that arrive through mixed-field papers
    (C4 +0.103; the mixed player's Shapley value exceeds the whole psp) and from turnover of hub partners. DOMAIN-old partners
    are negative. It is concept-level composition, not partner identity: a within-concept shuffle reproduces the low-degree
    contrast. The METHOD excess (P-A1) is DEV-only and not replicated in the cohort; P-A5 (drop vs add) fails. Bridging papers
    (5% of early home papers: more first-time authors, more off-home topics) halve NOVCHURN's psp (0.118 -> 0.056). CV ridge
    gain over B5 is small (+0.0015 to +0.004 Spearman). (B) Hashed trait prediction P-B1 FAILS: yearly OPEN_home ICC is 0.37/0.34/0.39
    (REML agrees), NOVCHURN 0.26-0.29, size control 0.64-0.73. The window retest is 0.51-0.57, the deg>=5 ICC about 0.50 and
    the disattenuated retest 0.86-0.91, so openness is a fair trait measured through a noisy yearly window. Outputs: results/exp11_completion.json,
    partner_classes.json, partner_shapley.json, trait_stability.json, bridging_papers_summary.json, method_out.json (exp_gen_sol_out),

  title: Is research-topic churn real or small-sample noise?
  summary: >-
    Cache-only ($0 LLM) confound check of the home-only churn/novelty signal on 13,444 selection concepts (DEV 4670, OLDHO
    3214, COH1014 4195, COH1517 1365; n_home_early>=10). Gate T0 reproduces EXP10 exactly (diff 0; cohort OPEN_home +0.0906,
    NOV_res +0.1337, edge_persistence -0.1123). A validated vectorised engine (lib/fast6.py == ego.concept_core to 1e-16)
    computes raw indicators and noise-controlled variants: V1 fixed-n rarefaction (n=5/10/20, 50 draws), V2 within-concept
    year-permutation null (200) + Chao-2005 Jaccard, V3 configuration nulls (200 igraph backbone rewires for density, k-matched
    set null, numba curveball for persistence), V4 split-half reliability; composites NOVCHURN_* and OPEN_home_clean/exc with
    constants sealed before outcome join. Findings (partial Spearman with O2r_m50 | B5+R2, B=2000, results/clean_vs_raw_psp.json):
    mechanical verdict PARTLY_THIN. Pooled NOVCHURN_raw +0.116 [0.09,0.14]; V2 excess NOVCHURN_exc +0.008 (retention 0.06;
    P1 fails: 0.40 COH1517, 0.05 OLDHO); fixed-n NOVCHURN_rare10 +0.078 (retention 0.68; 0.76 COH1517, 0.64 OLDHO); Chao/curveball
    composites keep 91-100%. Raw persistence is 66% explained by its own V2 null mean (thin-sample share), rho with log n
    +0.72, and the V2 null mean predicts the outcome (-0.120) at least as strongly as raw persistence (-0.088): the signal
    is a static topical-dispersion property of the home topic mix, not temporal partner turnover. V2 excess variants have
    split-half SB ~0.01-0.05 and PC2 (planted churn) fails, so V2 cannot adjudicate temporal churn at ~10 papers/year. Degree
    normalisation helps: z_dens_cfg -0.091 (raw density null), OPEN_home_clean +0.115 vs OPEN_home +0.092 same sample (diff
    +0.022 [0.011,0.034]); P2 z_pers_cfg -0.116 holds; P3 holds. Reliability SB: NOVCHURN_raw 0.48, OPEN_home 0.49, OPEN_home_clean
    0.58, outcome O2r_m50 0.895; disattenuated pooled NOVCHURN_raw 0.178 (approx). Frame-N joint power (OPEN R3&R5&NOVCHURN
    R3): 0.07/0.26 at n=800/2500 with T3, 0.31/0.75 with T2. Reusable outputs: data/clean_variants.parquet (per-concept raw+clean

    (hash-sealed), method_out.json (7,748 examples; DEV-fitted OLS predictions B5 +/- variants). Selection data, outcomes
    previously unsealed: robustness evidence, not confirmation. Independently re-derived (rederive.py, tests/headline_check.py,
    different code path; shuffled-outcome controls null): P1-P3 psp, pooled NOVCHURN_raw/exc/rare10, null-mean persistence,
    OPEN_home_clean psp, SB of NOVCHURN_raw, thin-sample share. Not re-derived: power simulation, DL pooling, disattenuation
    CIs.

<data_files>
Data files come in three sizes:
- preview_*_out.json — READ THIS to inspect the data structure
- mini_*_out.json (~3 examples) — use for prototyping/testing
- full_*_out.json (complete) — use for the final production run. NEVER open it directly (too large to read into context). Instead, extract values programmatically with shell commands (e.g. grep) or a Python script (use aii-long-running-tasks skill for scripts).
</data_files>

<trajectory>
One line per iteration from the run's own trajectory log: the hypothesis state, the move it made,
the review score, whether anything executed, and ``ledger_spend_usd`` — LLM/tool/container spend
billed so far, cumulative through that iteration. It is NOT the run's total cost: it excludes the
orchestrator's compute-rental time, which is usually the larger share of a long run. Use it for the
run's bookkeeping table (label the column "ledger spend" or similar, never "cost" or "total") and
to check that your chronology matches what the run recorded.

No trajectory log for this run.
</trajectory>

<available_figures>
The report's OWN figures, already rendered to files in `./figures/` by an earlier step. Every one
of them is a DATA figure — a chart drawn deterministically from this run's numbers — because that
is the only kind this document has. Insert each one where its `[FIGURE:fig_id]` marker sits in
<report_text>.

- \includegraphics{figures/<the filename from its own `figure_path` below>}, extension included
  (these are `.pdf`). Constrain it with `width=\linewidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio`
- Wrap each in \begin{figure}[!htbp] ... \caption{<the figure's own caption>} ... \label{...}
  ... \end{figure}, and refer to it as Figure~\ref{...} — never a hand-typed number
- Each caption was written from the rendered image. Look at the figure file before any sentence
  says what it shows, and name only colours, axes and panels the image actually has
- A marker of the literal form [FIGURE:fig_id] must never survive into the compiled document: it is
  the placeholder, and the figure float replaces it
- Do NOT draw anything yourself: no matplotlib, no PIL, no image generation. These files exist
- The count must match: as many \includegraphics as there are figures below, no more and no fewer

  Overview of the study design. (a) Concept identification: 56,643 legacy OpenAlex concepts are matched by title (Aho--Corasick)
  against a 476.2M-work OpenAlex snapshot, giving 60.0M verified matches; concepts are onset-dated ($t_0 \in$ 2003--2014),
  required to have early volume $\geq 30$ and to pass an LLM precision gate $\geq 0.80$, yielding an analysis panel of 12,499
  concepts. (b) Panel structure, bar lengths proportional to concept counts: DEV (blue; CS, Eng, BGM and Med homes, onset
  2003--09) 4,771, held-out field groups (grey; onset 2003--09) 3,372, and the 2010--14 onset cohort (green) 4,356. The expanded
  lower bar splits the held-out block into PHYS 742, LIFEENV 1,113, SOC 1,352 and MATHDEC 165. The panel contains 27,393 concept
  $\times$ off-home-field episodes over 26 venue fields; a separate fresh 2015--17 onset cohort of 1,443 concepts serves as
  a confirmatory frame. (c) Indicator screen for the breadth outcome (O2r\_m50). Bars are coloured by indicator family (A
  ego-net, E volume, F spread, FR frontier, G gateway, S co-author) with lengths proportional to indicator counts: 53 early
  indicators computed over $t_0..t_0{+}2$; 48 eligible on DEV (the 5 dropped D-family ego-net indicators were more than 30\%
  missing); the 10 frozen on DEV by partial Spearman correlation given the five-feature baseline B5 (A 3, F 1, FR 4, G 2);
  and the 7 confirmed on held-out units, the four held-out groups plus the two parts of the 2010--14 cohort (A 3, FR 4). (d)
  The two research questions, drawn as schematic illustrations with no data. RQ1 asks whether an open early ego network, as
  opposed to a closed one, predicts later cross-field breadth beyond B5. RQ2 asks whether the next field a concept enters
  (orange) is related to the off-home fields that currently retain it (light blue), starting from its home field (dark blue)
  on the field backbone.

title: Outcome distributions
caption: >-
  Distribution of the primary outcome, rarefied field breadth ($O_{2r}$, $m=50$), over the 7,203 of 12,499 frame concepts
  that have at least 50 papers in the $t_0{+}6$..$t_0{+}8$ outcome window ($O_{2r}$ is undefined below that). (a) Histogram
  of $O_{2r}$ in 1-field bins centred on the integers. The dashed orange line marks the median (4.73) and the light-blue band
  the interquartile range [3.41, 6.20]. The distribution is mildly right-skewed: most concepts reach 2--8 fields and a thin
  tail extends to 14. (b) $O_{2r}$ against the raw field count, the number of venue fields holding at least 15 of the concept's
  outcome-window papers. Grey dots are concepts (x jittered), blue diamonds are per-count medians (counts with $n \geq 5$)
  and the dashed black line is the 1:1 line. Rarefied breadth lies above the 1:1 line for 97.6\% of concepts and rises only
  weakly with the raw count (Spearman $\rho = 0.31$). It is nearly independent of outcome-window volume ($\rho = -0.06$),
  whereas the thresholded raw count grows with volume ($\rho = 0.41$). Rarefaction thus separates size-adjusted breadth from
  volume-driven field counts.

  row per family. Colour marks the family: retained frontier (FR), co-occurrence ego network (A), gateway landing (G), disciplinary
  spread (F), popularity (E) and co-author reach (S). Large filled circles are the 7 indicators confirmed on held-out fields;
  large open circles are the 3 selected on DEV but not confirmed; small dots are the 43 not selected. Selection kept indicators
  whose DEV 95\% CI excluded zero with at most 30\% missing, ranked them by $|$PSP$|$ and dropped near-duplicates ($|\rho|>0.85$).
  This is why some high-ranking DEV indicators (e.g.\ D\_rca\_end, and D\_rare, 88\% missing) are small dots. (b) The frozen
  top 10 in DEV rank order. Grey squares are the DEV estimates with 95\% concept-bootstrap CIs. Circles are held-out estimates
  pooled by DerSimonian--Laird over the PHYS, LIFEENV, SOC and MATHDEC groups, with 95\% CIs. Filled circles are confirmed
  (Holm $p<0.05$ with the frozen sign). All four retained-frontier (FR) and all three co-occurrence (A) selections replicate

summary: >-
  Shows that the churn signal is not temporal turnover (absorbed by permutation null) but survives rarefaction and degree-preserving
  configuration nulls.

</available_figures>

<document_requirements>
- ONE LaTeX file, `./report.tex`, compiled to `./report.pdf` with pdflatex. An article-class
  document with a title, a date, a table of contents and numbered sections. No bibliography is
  required. The figures are the ones in <available_figures> and nothing else: this document is
  prose, tables, numbers and the charts drawn from them
- EVERY table in <artifact_workspaces> is typeset as a real LaTeX table (`tabular` inside `table`,
  with a caption saying which artifact and which iteration it came from). A table that exists in an
  output file and not in this PDF is the one defect this document can have
- Long or wide tables use `longtable` or a smaller font rather than being truncated. Truncating a
  results table is the same defect as omitting it
- Every table fits the text width: a column of prose gets a `p{...}` width or a `tabularx` `X`
  column, which wrap; `l`, `c` and `r` columns never wrap and push the table past the margin. The
  compile log is checked, and a line running past the right margin sends the document back
- Numbers are copied, never rounded, re-derived or "cleaned up". If a number in <report_text>
  disagrees with the output file it came from, typeset the file's number and say in one sentence
  that the draft disagreed
- Plain `article` formatting is correct here. This is an internal record: no venue style, no
  two-column layout, no abstract-and-keywords front matter
- A section for every iteration, in order, plus a closing section on what the run learned overall
  and what is still open
- NO RAW COMMIT SHAS, full ISO timestamps, or run/artifact/task ids (`run_...`, `art_...`) in the
  prose, even here. Name an iteration by its number, an artifact by its name, a moment by a plain
  date — the internal id or the exact clock time behind it is bookkeeping this document copies
  numbers FROM, not text it repeats. If the run's git commit matters, cite the repo's published
  release TAG once, never a SHA
</document_requirements>

<executive_summary_requirements>
- A SECOND LaTeX file, `./exec_summary.tex`, compiled to `./exec_summary.pdf` with
  pdflatex in this same directory. HARD CAP: at most 4 pages. The page count is
  read from the compiled PDF; a longer one is sent back and is never published
- Built from the same inputs as the report: the per-artifact `summary` fields in
  <artifact_workspaces>, for EVERY round (the report's iterations), with <iteration_records> for
  why each round ran what it ran and <report_text> for the run's goal. Where a summary quotes a
  number, check it against the artifact's output files as the report does
- For a reader with five minutes: plain article, titled with the paper's title from
  <paper_headline>, a date, no table of contents, no bibliography. These sections, in this order:
  1. Headline: the paper's headline from <paper_headline>, never another finding: its number,
     interval and evidence grade, its scope, and its source (artifact name and round). Check each
     against the artifact output files and the round record first. Where the record supports it,
     state it as the paper does. Where it does not (the files give another number, or the record
     grades it lower than the paper), still lead with the paper's headline, give the record's
     number and grade, and flag the conflict in one sentence. Never swap in a different finding
     as the headline
  2. Goal: what the run set out to find or build, in one paragraph
  3. What was tried: one or two sentences per round, every round present and in order
  4. Key results: the numbers that matter, each with its source (artifact name and round) and
     its grade as the round record gives it; a compact table is the right shape
  5. What failed: the dead ends and negative results, each with the reason
  6. Open questions: what the run did not settle
- Page counts: the paper does not exist yet (it is typeset after this summary), so never state
  its page count. The one page count the summary may give is the full report's, read from the
  compiled `./report.pdf` (`pdfinfo`), never estimated
- The report's rules hold here too: numbers copied, never rounded; no ids, SHAs or clock times;
  every code link on this run's branch. At most one figure from <available_figures>, only if it
  earns its space; none is fine
- It condenses the report and must never disagree with it
- Its last page is not near empty: a closing footer or a few lines alone on a final page send it
  back, so fit them on the page before (no `\vfill` before a closing footer) or cut them
- A result about defeating a model's safeguards is stated per <safeguard_research_reporting>: a
  measurement and what it means for evaluation and defence, never a recommendation or a
  configuration for removing refusals. "Headline" and "Key results" included
</executive_summary_requirements>

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Read and STRICTLY follow these skills: aii-paper-to-latex.
TODO 2. READ THE RUN. Open every directory in <artifact_workspaces> and read every output file it
declares — the JSON, the CSVs, the logs, the metrics, per <data_files>. List, for yourself, every result table you
found and which artifact and iteration it belongs to. This list is what the report is checked
against, so build it before you write anything.
TODO 3. WRITE `./report.tex`. Follow the aii-paper-to-latex skill's setup for the
preamble and the compile loop, then depart from its paper structure: this document is
chronological, one numbered section per iteration in order. In each iteration's section write why
it ran what it ran, what it built, EVERY table it produced, what the reviewer said, what the
hypothesis update concluded and why it moved — then what the next iteration took from it. Keep
the dead ends and label them. Close with what the run learned overall and what is still open.
TODO 4. PLACE EVERY FIGURE. Insert each figure in <available_figures> as a float at its own
`[FIGURE:fig_id]` marker in <report_text>, with that figure's own caption and a \label, and
delete the marker text itself. Then count: `grep -c includegraphics` must equal the number of
figures listed there. If <available_figures> says there are none, there is nothing to do here.
TODO 5. TYPESET EVERY TABLE. Walk your list from the first todo and confirm each result table is in
the document as a real `tabular`, with its caption naming the artifact and the iteration. Any
table you left out goes in now. Then add the run's bookkeeping table from <trajectory>: one row
per iteration with its move, review score, whether anything executed, and its ledger spend so far
(label the column accordingly — it excludes compute-rental time, so it is not the run's total
cost).
TODO 6. COMPILE `./report.pdf` per the skill's process and fix every error until it
builds. Then check the document against <artifact_workspaces> once more: every artifact named
there must appear by name somewhere in the report. Report any that genuinely produced nothing,
rather than silently dropping them.
TODO 7. READ THE PDF. Convert every page of `./report.pdf` to PNG at 150 DPI (pdf2image
or pymupdf) and read them. Look for tables running off the page, overfull boxes, sections out of
order and numbers that disagree with each other. Fix and recompile. The ONLY exception is if all
page images would not fit in your remaining context — in that case, read as many as fit and state
which pages you are skipping and why.
TODO 8. WRITE `./exec_summary.tex` per <executive_summary_requirements>, from the report
you just finished and the inputs above. Its title is the paper's title and its first section
leads with the paper's headline from <paper_headline>, with its number and evidence grade as the
round record supports them, or the conflict flagged. Every round gets its line under "What was
tried"; every number under "Headline" and "Key results" names the artifact and round it came
from.
TODO 9. COMPILE `./exec_summary.pdf` and COUNT ITS PAGES (`pdfinfo` or pypdf's
`len(PdfReader(path).pages)`). Over 4 pages, trim: tighter prose, fewer
table rows, a smaller figure or none. Never drop a round or a section to fit. Recompile until it is
at most 4 pages, then convert every page to PNG and read them.
</todos>

---

## LaTeX Paper Assembly

Assembles a research paper from paper text, pre-generated figures (vector `.pdf` for data figures, `.jpg` for concept figures) and a bibliography into a compiled PDF.

### Document Setup

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}
\usepackage{graphicx, geometry, amsmath, hyperref, url, natbib, booktabs, xcolor, listings}
\geometry{margin=1in}
\hypersetup{colorlinks=true, linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, urlcolor=black}
```

### Figure Inclusion

CRITICAL: Include ALL figures. Every figure MUST appear in the paper.

```latex
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio]{figures/filename.pdf}
  \caption{Descriptive caption.}
  \label{fig:label}
\end{figure}
```

Rules:
- ALWAYS `[!htbp]` — all four options, so a float can never be deferred to the end of the
  document, which `[t]` or `[h]` alone risks. Do not ask for a page TOP: `[!t]` and
  `[!tbp]` both floated a figure ABOVE the paper's own title on page 1, where `[!htbp]`
  on the same document did not. Where a figure lands is decided by where it is declared
  in the text
- Use `figure`, never `figure*`. This document class is ONE column, so `figure*` is exactly
  as wide as `figure` (469.76pt either way) and gains nothing, while restricting the float
  to a page top
- ALWAYS constrain with `width` and `keepaspectratio`. Add `height` only as a
  LAST RESORT against a very tall figure overrunning the page, and keep it
  generous — `0.85\textheight`. A tight height cap binds on ordinary figures
  and LaTeX then shrinks the TEXT with them: at `0.4\textheight` a square
  figure printed at 50.9%, putting 11 pt axis labels on the page at 5.6 pt.
  The figure generator measures legibility at the figure's OWN size, so it
  cannot see this happen
- Every figure needs `\caption`, `\label`, and a `\ref` in the text
- Do NOT convert figures to tables or describe them without inserting the image
- Do NOT skip any figures

### Compilation Process

Run each command separately (do NOT chain with `&&` — pdflatex often exits non-zero on warnings, which would skip bibtex and leave citations as `??`):

```bash
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
bibtex paper
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
```

All four commands are required. Skipping bibtex causes `??` in all citations.
Fix any errors between runs. Verify `./paper.pdf` was created.

### Output Files

- `./paper.tex` — LaTeX source
- `./references.bib` — bibliography file
- `./paper.pdf` — compiled PDF
- `./figures/` — all figure images (pre-generated, copied into workspace). Data
  figures are `.pdf` (vector — LaTeX renders their text at page resolution, which
  is what keeps axis labels sharp in print); concept figures are `.jpg`. Use each
  file's OWN extension in `\includegraphics`; there is no conversion step.

### [3] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-30 09:31:53 UTC

```
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user provided a comprehensive prompt (inside `<pasted_content>`) requiring:
   - **Typeset a research report** (`report.tex` → `report.pdf`): An internal chronological research report covering all 5 iterations of a scientific study about whether temporal network signals predict how scientific concepts spread across disciplines. Must include every table from every artifact, every figure, chronological iteration sections, dead ends, and a closing section.
   - **Write an executive summary** (`exec_summary.tex` → `exec_summary.pdf`): At most 4 pages, titled with the paper's title, leading with the paper's headline finding, covering all rounds, key results, failures, and open questions.
   - **Output JSON** to `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` with a specific schema including title, coverage_note, and file paths.
   - **Disposable outputs**: Create `.aii/manifest.yaml` and `README.md` for the workspace.

   The report must be chronological (one section per iteration), complete (every experiment table), reasoned, honest about dead ends, and never sell results. Numbers must be copied exactly from artifact files. No raw IDs, SHAs, or timestamps in prose.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - **LaTeX typesetting** with article class, specific packages (graphicx, geometry, amsmath, hyperref, natbib, booktabs, xcolor, etc.)
   - **pdflatex compilation** process: pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex → pdflatex (each run separately, not chained with &&)
   - **Figure inclusion**: `[!htbp]`, `width=\linewidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio`, all figures are `.pdf` vector files
   - **OpenAlex corpus analysis**: 476M works, 12,499 concepts, 27,393 adoption episodes, 26 fields
   - **Statistical methods**: Partial Spearman priority (PSP), DerSimonian-Laird pooling, Holm correction, conditional logit, ElasticNet, EBM
   - **OPEN index**: 6-component composite (new edge rate, n_comm, participation, NOV_res, ego density, edge persistence)
   - **Key metrics**: Rarefied field breadth (O2r), retained-field relatedness (d0), ideational consistency
   - **Five iterations** of experimentation with hash-sealed specifications, held-out validation, and multiple artifact types (experiments, evaluations, datasets, research)

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **Workspace**: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_ud-q6jnkjLXa/4_gen_paper_repo/_4_assemble_paper/report_workspace`
   - **figures/ directory**: Contains 11 PDF figures confirmed present:
     - `fig_overview_v0.pdf`, `fig_outcomes_v0.pdf`, `fig_rq1_confirmed_v0.pdf`, `fig_full_screen_v0.pdf`, `fig_open_ladder_v0.pdf`, `fig_frame_n_v0.pdf`, `fig_cheng_reversal_v0.pdf`, `fig_field_entry_v0.pdf`, `fig_decomp_v0.pdf`, `fig_mechanism_v0.pdf`, `fig_confound_v0.pdf`
   - **iteration_records.yaml**: Read ~1700 lines covering all 5 iterations with strategies, plans, reviews (all score 2-3, all blocking), hypothesis updates, and detailed critiques
   - **preview_method_out.json files read**: For gen_art_experiment_1 (iteration 1), gen_art_experiment_3 (iteration 1), gen_art_experiment_4 (iteration 1), gen_art_experiment_5 (iteration 2), gen_art_experiment_6 (iteration 2), gen_art_evaluation_1 (iteration 2)
   - **Key artifact data from previews**:
     - Exp1: delta_rho = -0.005645, rho_B = 0.8338, survives = false, 48 concepts
     - Exp3: D delta_rho = 0.006, F delta_rho = -0.060, both fail pre-registered rule, 47 concepts
     - Exp4: G screen on 46 dev concepts, delta-rho +0.033, does NOT survive
     - Exp5: 12,499 concepts, 27,393 episodes, H1 dAUC -0.00001 (DISCONFIRMED)
     - Exp6: 653 concepts, H2 entry d=0.30 (CONFIRMED)
   - **Files to create** (not yet created):
     - `./report.tex` → `./report.pdf`
     - `./exec_summary.tex` → `./exec_summary.pdf`
     - `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json`
     - `./.aii/manifest.yaml`
     - `./README.md`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - No errors encountered yet. The work is still in the reading/planning phase.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Successfully loaded the aii-paper-to-latex skill to understand formatting requirements
   - Read iteration records to understand the full chronological structure of the 5-iteration run
   - Read preview output files to verify key numbers from artifacts
   - Confirmed all 11 figure files exist in the figures/ directory
   - Identified the complete list of artifacts across all iterations (18 artifacts total: experiments 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16; evaluations 1,2,3,4; dataset 2; research 1,2,3)

6. All user messages:
   - The user's only message is the large pasted content block containing the full task specification. Key constraints from system prompts and the pasted content:
     - "Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently."
     - "No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional."
     - "CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory"
     - "NEVER kill processes by name" (process isolation)
     - Numbers must be "copied, never rounded, re-derived or 'cleaned up'"
     - "NO RAW COMMIT SHAS, full ISO timestamps, or run/artifact/task ids in the prose"
     - "A table that exists in an output file and not in this PDF is the one defect this document can have"
     - "Long or wide tables use longtable or a smaller font rather than being truncated"
     - "Every table fits the text width" — columns must not push past the margin
     - Report must have a "section for every iteration, in order, plus a closing section"
     - Exec summary HARD CAP: at most 4 pages
     - The paper_headline finding is: "OPEN_home predicts cross-field breadth, evidence synthesis across non-selection bodies" with effect 0.069, CI [0.038, 0.100], outcome: exploratory

7. Pending Tasks:
   - **Task 3** (in_progress): Write `./report.tex` - chronological LaTeX document with all iterations, tables, and figures
   - **Task 4** (pending): Place every figure from available_figures at [FIGURE:fig_id] markers
   - **Task 5** (pending): Typeset every table from artifacts as real LaTeX tables
   - **Task 6** (pending): Compile `./report.pdf` and fix errors
   - **Task 7** (pending): Read the compiled PDF visually (convert to PNG at 150 DPI)
   - **Task 8** (pending): Write `./exec_summary.tex`
   - **Task 9** (pending): Compile `./exec_summary.pdf` and verify ≤4 pages
   - Create `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` (final output)
   - Create `./.aii/manifest.yaml` and `./README.md`

8. Current Work:
   I had just marked Task 3 (Write report.tex) as in_progress. I had completed reading the run data (Task 2) — reading iteration_records.yaml across all 5 iterations and preview output files from 6 artifacts. I was about to begin writing the report.tex file.

   The report.tex needs to be structured as follows based on `<document_requirements>`:
   - Article class, title, date, table of contents, numbered sections
   - One section per iteration (5 iterations), chronological
   - Every table from every artifact as real LaTeX tabular environments
   - All 11 figures placed at their [FIGURE:fig_id] markers from `<report_text>`
   - A closing section on what the run learned and what's still open
   - Based on `<report_text>` content but restructured chronologically

   Key tables to include from `<report_text>`:
   - Panel composition (Table 1)
   - Held-out indicator screen (Table 2, 10 rows)
   - OPEN index control ladder (Table 3)
   - Breadth decomposition (Table 4)
   
   Additional tables needed from artifact summaries across all iterations covering screen results, field entry results, consistency reversal data, confound corrections, etc.

   The aii-paper-to-latex skill requires:
   - `\documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}`
   - `\usepackage{graphicx, geometry, amsmath, hyperref, url, natbib, booktabs, xcolor, listings}`
   - `\geometry{margin=1in}`
   - `\hypersetup{colorlinks=true, linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, urlcolor=black}`
   - Figures with `[!htbp]` and `width=\linewidth,height=0.85\textheight,keepaspectratio`
   - Compilation: pdflatex, bibtex, pdflatex, pdflatex (run separately)

9. Optional Next Step:
   Write the complete `./report.tex` file. This is Task 3 which was just set to in_progress. The document structure should follow the `<report_text>` paper content (which provides the scientific narrative, tables, and figure placements) restructured into a chronological internal report format with one section per iteration.

   Per the TODO list: "WRITE ./report.tex. Follow the aii-paper-to-latex skill's setup for the preamble and the compile loop, then depart from its paper structure: this document is chronological, one numbered section per iteration in order. In each iteration's section write why it ran what it ran, what it built, EVERY table it produced, what the reviewer said, what the hypothesis update concluded and why it moved — then what the next iteration took from it."

   After writing report.tex, I need to compile it (Task 6), visually inspect it (Task 7), then write and compile the exec summary (Tasks 8-9), and finally output the JSON file.

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /var/lib/aii-agent/claude/projects/-ai-inventor-aii-data-runs-run-ud-q6jnkjLXa-4-gen-paper-repo--4-assemble-paper-report-workspace/30362ebc-7684-45ac-9cc4-d5faccc5b208.jsonl
Continue the conversation from where it left off without asking the user any further questions. Resume directly — do not acknowledge the summary, do not recap what was happening, do not preface with "I'll continue" or similar. Pick up the last task as if the break never happened.

Schema validation found 1 problem — fix ALL of them at once:
  - at `<root>`: 'out_expected_files' is a required property
Every required field must be present and every field type must match the schema.

Produce `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` again so it contains corrected JSON that matches the schema. Do not invent new fields.

REPORT COVERAGE FAILED: 9 artifact(s) from <artifact_workspaces> are not mentioned anywhere in report.tex.

This document is the run's complete record, and an artifact missing from it is a result the run produced and then lost:
- gen_art_experiment_6
- gen_art_dataset_2
- gen_art_research_1
- gen_art_evaluation_2
- gen_art_research_2
- gen_art_evaluation_3
- gen_art_research_3
- gen_art_experiment_13
- gen_art_experiment_15

You MUST:
1. Open each artifact's workspace directory and read the output files it declared
2. Add it to the section for the iteration it belongs to: what it was for, what it produced, and EVERY result table in its output files, typeset as a real `tabular`
3. If it genuinely produced nothing, say so in one sentence in that section and name it — an artifact that failed is part of the record too
4. Leave everything else as it is, then recompile the PDF

LAYOUT CHECK FAILED in report.tex:
- lines 196--196 of report.tex run 47pt past the right margin, where the page cuts them off
- lines 385--386 of report.tex run 84pt past the right margin, where the page cuts them off
- lines 407--408 of report.tex run 37pt past the right margin, where the page cuts them off
- lines 597--597 of report.tex run 38pt past the right margin, where the page cuts them off
- lines 646--646 of report.tex run 15pt past the right margin, where the page cuts them off

You MUST:
1. Make each table at those lines fit \textwidth: give prose columns a `p{...}` width or use `tabularx` with `X` columns so their cells wrap, set it in \footnotesize, and split a table with too many columns in two. Never leave long text in an `l`, `c` or `r` column, and never shrink a whole table with \resizebox
2. Let a long word, URL, \texttt run or inline formula break (\url, \allowbreak, a formula split into several $...$ pieces or set as display math) instead of overrunning
3. Change nothing else: text, tables and numbers stay as they are
4. Recompile, then check: `grep 'Overfull .hbox' report.log` lists nothing more than a few points wide, and the last page is more than a few lines

<CRITICAL_ERROR>
The module-end file check FAILED (attempt 1/3).

PROBLEMS:
  - .aii/manifest.yaml has no top-level 'entries:' list

FIX IT:
1. Add one entry per uncovered path to `.aii/manifest.yaml` (create it if missing).
   Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve inside it. Globs and
   whole directories are fine — a whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry.

   entries:
     - path: results/
       keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible in this run
     - path: hf_cache/
       delete: redownloadable
       source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
     - path: checkpoints/
       delete: regenerable
       source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3"

   `keep:` takes a one-line reason. `delete:` takes `redownloadable` or
   `regenerable` and a `source:` that brings the files back.
2. Make sure `README.md` reads like a GitHub repository README: what you did,
   the layout (a line per important file/dir), how to run it, and a
   "Restoring removed files" section with the command for EVERY delete entry.
3. Text and code files never need a decision, and neither does anything under
   the auto-keep floor. Only large binaries and cache directories do.
